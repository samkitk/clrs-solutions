<p>CONNECTED-COMPONENTS procedure computes a graph in such a way
that it puts all the vertices of the same component in its own set.
.</p>
<p>The algorithm for the CONNECTED-COMPONENTS is the following:</p>
<p>CONNECTED-COMPONENTS (G)</p>
<p>// <i>loop through each of the vertices in the Graph</i></p>
<p>1. for vertex <img src=
"../imgs/5933ccce569093c4108f9ec0db0d8de3297f0c18.png"></p>
<p>// <i>create sets for each of the vertices in the Graph</i></p>
<p>2. <img src=
"../imgs/9211387e9229c87d5a2d13d356cc3c45b5895b8d.png"></p>
<p>// <i>loop through each of the edges of the Graph</i></p>
<p>3. for <img src=
"../imgs/f67d41188bfb5e46fc295c5c1b72f684f03d95e7.png"></p>
<p><i>// check if both the vertices of the edge are in the same set
or not</i></p>
<p>4. if <img src=
"../imgs/fc5e86062694eb2b73f0b37e4a7632075b317fab.png"></p>
<p><i>// if the vertices are not in the same set, then join the
sets to form one set</i></p>
<p>5. <img src=
"../imgs/9033e38894f1c2f655de20a47f2e88d79441bdee.png"></p>
<p>From the above algorithm it can be observed easily that every
vertex that belongs to the graph at first gets its own set. And
then for every edge, the two vertices which form the edge are
brought into the same SET using the UNION procedure.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">
<p>There are two perspectives to this proof.</p>
<p>After processing all the edges, the following two observations
have to be seen:</p>
<p>• If two vertices are in the same set, then they are part of a
connected component.</p>
<p>• If two vertices are part of a connected component, then they
are in the same set.</p>
<p><b>Proof that if two vertices are in the same set, then they are
part of a connected component:</b></p>
<p>Initially every vertex has its own set as seen from step 1 and 2
in the above algorithm. At this stage, there is no edge between any
of the vertices as no edge has been looked at yet.</p>
<p>So, the property that if two vertices are in same set, then they
are part of a connected component holds initially.</p>
<p>Now after processing a single edge<img src=
"../imgs/29920df19f2ab74aa6b7c822e3c753a780e53178.png"> the
following is observed:</p>
<p>The edges <img src=
"../imgs/e6db7907f47c792385f87cce217f933fd52f10b3.png"> and
<img src="../imgs/22e5145793d8f84321bf4024a3efc21a89be6023.png">
are put into the same set implying that they are part of a
connected component. This is true because they form an edge. So,
the property under consideration holds true even after the
processing of the first edge.</p>
<p>Let’s assume that an edge<img src=
"../imgs/24a4203c0dfb9c75322bb9009d3ce0c02df0f33c.png">.</p>
<p>There are two possibilities of processing this edge:</p>
<p>1.<img src=
"../imgs/ba1bcf9f4092b61dafb5144f6bff96831d7377bb.png"> before
taking the union but <img src=
"../imgs/8c4b5e4bb4d6859b3ba92f0b5ef0f91c9cbdeb12.png">after taking
the union. This is because before the edge was seen, it was not in
the same set implying that it doesn’t belong to the same component
but once the edge is seen, it is processed by UNION and now it is
in the same set implying that it belongs to the same component.
This is true because it is an edge which means that it must be part
of the same component.</p>
<p>2.<img src=
"../imgs/8c4b5e4bb4d6859b3ba92f0b5ef0f91c9cbdeb12.png">before
taking the union but <img src=
"../imgs/ba1bcf9f4092b61dafb5144f6bff96831d7377bb.png">after taking
the union. If this could happen, then it would show that two
vertices that do not belong to the same connected component were
once in the same set. But it cannot happen because all that is done
during the processing of the edges is either UNION them or don’t
union them. If UNION is done, then the previous status of already
being in the same set doesn’t change. And if UNION is not done,
then obviously nothing is done in this step and so the previous
status of being in the same set must prevail.</p>
<p>Thus, it cannot happen that two vertices which are in the same
set are not in same connected component.</p>
<p><b>So, it is shown that any two vertices that are in the same
set are also in the same connected component.</b></p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">
<p><b>Proof that if two vertices are in the same connected
component, then they are part of the same set:</b></p>
<p>Assume that <img src=
"../imgs/e240dd1ea4c3fbdf1f173a7cbcabbbcbad58a4ad.png">are two
vertices in the same connected component. There are other vertices
in the connected component. Let them be denoted by <img src=
"../imgs/792af20588c7b481f3234a9ae64e00a34e7e96de.png"> such that
<img src="../imgs/15054a55e6299227b0009ee8e301e313b7eeccb1.png"> is
an edge. So, each edge is processed one by one using<img src=
"../imgs/42101a5700948001380223154a2ae64ed14708f4.png">. When each
instance of this is processed, they get put into the same set
because they are edges and the algorithm puts the vertices of every
edge into the same set. Thus after all the edges in the connected
component are processed, the following is observed:</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/7634b6ec9009af98648f95824761d55943984c12.png"></p>
<p>So, the set of all the vertices in the above connected component
is the same.</p>
<p>This is because every adjacent vertex in a connected component
is in the same set because they are an edge. And every other vertex
in the connected component is adjacent to the initial vertex
indirectly. And in turn all of them are in the same set.</p>
<p><b>Thus, it is shown that any two vertices which are in the same
connected component are in the same set.</b></p>
<p><b>Hence, it is proved that after all the edges are processed by
CONNECTED-COMPONENTS; two vertices are in the same connected
component if and only if they are in the same set.</b></p>
