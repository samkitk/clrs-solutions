<p><b>Dynamic open address hash table</b></p>
<p>The dynamic table is a table that continuously changes its size
dynamically. Upon insertion of new values in the table, the size
increases as it occupies a space or slot and upon deletion of
values the table size decreases as it frees the slots. The change
in size of table is limited to a certain value which is the load
factor of the table.</p>
<p>A load factor in a nonempty table is the ratio of number of the
elements in a dynamic table divided by size of the dynamic table.
The hash table is a data structure used to store, insert, delete
and check certain elements in it. Here, the hash table is used in
the practical implementation of the dynamic table.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">
<p>The implementation of dynamic table by open addressing hash
table is simply done where the new element, which is about to be
inserted, is first checked whether it is really in the hash table
or not or there is any unused space left. An actual cost is the
cost of every operation alone and the amortized cost is the average
cost of the total operations taken altogether. And our main concern
should be of how to make the amortized cost<img src=
"../imgs/3701f6db75733aef7243b99d0bc7d773aa3c8a94.png">.</p>
The hash tables must have a load factor strictly less than 1 or
less than 100% as the load factor increases, so does the complexity
and the hash table becomes slow. In this condition the search and
various functions that are run through the hash tables, might even
fail to run.</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">
<p>The insertion action is taken along with the search function.
This takes an average of <img src=
"../imgs/1a388e7cdbdeb64bd5c4ee89f88212256a91be3f.png">times as it
does a linear search. But they must have an amortized cost
associated with it too. Using the amortized analysis, the amortized
cost of insertion and deletion is only<img src=
"../imgs/3701f6db75733aef7243b99d0bc7d773aa3c8a94.png">, even
though the actual cost of an operation is larger, when it triggers
an expansion or a contraction.</p>
<p>So, the actual cost is assumed to be<img src=
"../imgs/3701f6db75733aef7243b99d0bc7d773aa3c8a94.png">; and this
is the expected value per insertion.</p>
<p>The unused space in a dynamic table never exceeds a constant
fraction of the total space.</p>
<p>The average cost per instruction is not<img src=
"../imgs/3701f6db75733aef7243b99d0bc7d773aa3c8a94.png">, as the
searching might check all the entries of the hash table to find the
answer.</p>

<p>During deletion there are the following possibilities:</p>
<p>1. The table size remains the same, which means that the table
does not have to contract.</p>
<p>2<b>.</b> The table has to contract to half its value (assumed
to the opposite of the insertion function where the table has to
expand its size to double).</p>
In the 1<sup>st</sup> case, the load factor <img src=

greater than the half value of the table. Now we can see that after

<p>Since in the above cases<img src=

<p>Dynamic tables are the tables that can expand and contrast
according to the data to be stored in the table to save the space

<p>There is a constant bound on the load factor of the table and
the amortized cost is also bounded with some constant. The

There are two cases to discuss first are when the element is
