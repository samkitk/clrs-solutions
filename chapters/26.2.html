<p>Flow network is the network which shows the automation of
assembly line in the company from the warehouse to the
manufacturing location and vice versa. In this network the raw
material go to the destination through various stages to be a
finished product.</p>
<p>The flow network has two basic terms that is flow of data and
the capacity of the node or intermediate location.</p>

<p><b>Execution of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm</b></p>
<p>Edmond-Karp algorithm is the better version of Ford-Fulkerson
algorithm and is used to compute the maximum flow in a network. The
Edmond-Karp algorithm is same as the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm,
except that Breadth first search (BFS) algorithm is used in the
Edmond-Karp algorithm to find the augment path.</p>
<p><b>The following is the Edmond-Karp algorithm:</b></p>
<p>EDMONDS-KARP(<i>G,s,t</i>)</p>
<p>1 <b>for</b> each edge (<i>u,v</i>) <img src=
"../imgs/4f8024863c8f68865105c834f3e4ea3b6d5a7191.png"><i>G.E</i></p>
<p>2 (<i>u,v</i>).<i>f</i> = 0</p>
<p>//Breadth first search(BFS) is used to find the path
<i>p</i></p>
<p>3 <b>while</b> there is a path <i>p</i> from <i>s</i> to
<i>t</i> in the residual network</p>
<p>4 <i>c</i><sub>f</sub> (<i>p</i>)= min { <i>c</i><sub>f</sub>
(<i>u,v</i>): (<i>u,v</i>)is in <i>p</i>}</p>
<p>5 <b>for</b> each edge (<i>u,v</i>) in <i>p</i></p>
<p>6 <b>if</b> (<i>u,v</i>) <img src=
"../imgs/4f8024863c8f68865105c834f3e4ea3b6d5a7191.png">

<p>7 (<i>u,v</i>).<i>f</i> = (<i>u,v</i>).<i>f</i> +
<i>c</i><sub>f</sub> (<i>p</i>)</p>
<p>8 <b>else</b> (<i>v,u</i>).<i>f</i> = (<i>v,u</i>).<i>f</i> +
<i>c</i><sub>f</sub> (<i>p</i>)</p>
<p>• The EDMONDS-KARP algorithm sets the flow of all the edges to 0
in line 1-2.</p>
<p>• The Edmond-Karp algorithm uses the Breadth first search (BFS)
algorithm to find the augment path in line 3. That is, in the
Edmond-Karp algorithm, the augment path from source to sink is the
path with minimum number of edges in the residual network.</p>
<p>• If there exist a path <i>p</i> in the residual network
<i>G</i><sub>f</sub> , then the minimum capacity of the path
<i>p</i> is calculated in line 4 using the following formula:</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/4ce4f05fea4dabb30076f7df19cf66e7f241e34c.png"></p>
<p>• Each edge in the path <i>p</i> is then augmented by <img src=
"../imgs/d6c274e54334fbc7ce9a2c44ec15617ba9db1be4.png">and then the
residual graph is updated in the line 6- 8.</p>
<p>• The above steps are repeated until there is a path <i>p</i> in
<i>G</i><sub>f</sub>.</p>

<p>Consider the problem of converting a network with multiple
sources and multiple sinks to a single source and a single sink. In
this conversion, edges with infinite capacity are added from super
source to all the sources, and edges with infinite capacity are
added from sinks to super sink.</p>
<p><b>Flow in the new network has a finite value:</b></p>
<p>• To find a maximum flow of a network with multiple sources and
multiple sinks, convert it into a single source to single sink
problem and apply FORD-FULKERSON method.</p>
<p>• It can be observed that any flow in the resulting network
corresponds to a flow in the multi-source, multi-sink network with
the same flow.</p>
<p>• Consider that the edges of original network with multiple
sources and sinks have finite capacity. While running
FORD-FULKERSON algorithm on the resulting network, it can be
observed that any flow along the augment path is finite, since the
residual capacity is the capacity of any edge in the original
network and it is finite.</p>
<p><b>Therefore, any flow in the resulting network is finite, if
the edges of the original network have finite capacity.</b></p>
<p>Alternatively, a cut can be constructed such that it separates
all the sources from all the sinks. That is, only edges of the
original network cross the cut. Since only the edges of original
network cross the cut, the net flow across the cut is finite.</p>
<p><b>Thus,</b> <b>the capacity of the cut is finite and any flow
in the single-source , single-sink network is finite.</b></p>

<p>Since the flow conservation is not violated, we can inherently
say that the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm would still remain
correct.</p>

FORD-FULKERSON and we will still be able to compute the maximum

<p>Run the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm and make the changes in it that
an edge is removed if the flow of the graph G reaches its capacity.
If <i>f(u,v)=c(u,v),</i>where <i>f(u,v)</i> denotes the flow of the
graph and <i>c(u,v)</i> denotes the capacity of the graph then
there should not exist any reverse edge in the residual
network.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">
<p>The result of the modified Ford-Fulkerson algorithm are the
augmenting paths which are needed. There are at most |E| paths
because every augmenting path produces at least one edge whose flow
is equal to its capacity, which is set to be the actual flow for
the edge in a maximum flow and the modification prevents the
destruction of this program.</p>
<p>Thus, the main steps are:</p>
<p>• Find the maximum flow</p>
<p>• Get the minimum cut of the network.</p>
<p>• When one edge is saturated on the minimum cut each time, the
upper bound is |E|</p>

<p><b>Flow Network</b></p>
<p>A flow network, in the most basic form, is a directed graph.
Each of the edges has a capacity assigned to it. In the network a

<p>There are certain nodes in the graph from which the flow starts
and to which the flow ends. These two nodes are called the source

<div class="answer">
<p><b>Flow conservation:</b></p>
<p>In the flow network the flow conservation is defined as the
property that none of the vertices that are not source or sink can
store or create the flow.</p>
<p>That is for each vertex the flow coming to a vertex is same as
the flow passing from that vertex. It means the total flow for a
vertex at any time is zero.</p>
<p>For a graph <i>G</i>(<i>V</i>, <i>E</i>) having edge <img src=

<p>The flow value of the edge which is not present in the edge set
<i>E</i> will be zero that is <img src=

<p><b>Capacity constraint:</b></p>
<p>The capacity of a vertex is the limit of the flow that can be
allowed by the vertex to flow from that vertex. No edge can pass
the flow through it beyond its capacity.</p>
<p>For any edge <img src=
"../imgs/b548683a2ac11bfb638001c9ebbc303779aae81e.png">the value of

</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">
<p><b>Proof for flow conservation and capacity constraint:</b></p>
<p>Consider the graph <i>G</i> (<i>V</i>, <i>E</i>)</p>
<p>Where <i>V</i> = the set of vertices and</p>
<p><i>E=</i> the set of edges in the graph. For any edge<img src=

follows:</p>
<p><img src=

<p>It implies that the new flow on each edge is simply the sum of
the two flows on that edge.</p>

<p><b>Finding Edge connectivity:</b></p>
<p>Finding edge connectivity problem is an application of max-flow
min-cut theorem. Min-cut of a network <i>G</i> is the cut whose
capacity is the least of all possible cuts of <i>G</i>.</p>
<p>• If the capacities of all edges are 1, then the min-cut equals
the edge capacity.</p>
<p>• If minimum cut is <i>k</i>, edge connectivity is also
<i>k</i>. That is, <i>G</i> can be disconnected on removing
<i>k</i> edges.</p>
<p><b>Solving Edge connectivity problem:</b></p>
<p>Consider that max-flow algorithm runs on a network and returns a
max-flow of a residual graph.</p>
<p>Thus, Edge connectivity problem can be solved using the max-flow
algorithm as follows:</p>
<p>• For any two vertices <i>u</i> and <i>v</i> in <i>G</i>, a flow
network <i>G</i><sub>uv</sub> with directed edges of capacity 1 can
be defined such that, <i>s</i>=<i>u</i> and <i>t</i>=<i>v</i>.</p>
<p>• The max-flow algorithm like FORD-FULKERSON can be applied to
find max-flow of <i>G</i><sub>uv</sub> .</p>
<p>• Since all capacities are 1, the number of edges crossing a cut
equals the capacity of the cut.</p>

<p>6 <i>k</i>=min(<i>k</i>, <i>f</i><sub>uv</sub>)</p>
<p>7 <b>return</b> <i>k</i>|</p>
<p>The above algorithm runs O(V) times and finds the capacity of
all possible cuts. The algorithm finds minimum of all these
capacities in line 6. That is, <i>k</i> edges should be removed to
disconnect the network.</p>

<p><b>Flow Network</b></p>
<p>A flow network, in the most basic form, is a directed graph.
Each of the edges has a capacity assigned to it. In the network a
certain amount of flow goes from each edge of the network. There
are certain nodes in the graph from which the flow starts and to
which the flow ends. These two nodes are called the source and sink
of the network respectively.</p>
<p>In the diagram below the node <i>s</i> is the source of the
network and the node <i>t</i> is the destination or sink of the
network. Each of the graph edge has a capacity. The capacity
defines the data value that can go through that edge. The capacity
is always a positive integer. One more thing is that if there is an
edge from a vertex <i>v</i><sub>1</sub> to vertex
<i>v</i><sub>2</sub> than there can be no edge from
<i>v</i><sub>2</sub> to <i>v</i><sub>1</sub>.</p>

<p>In the above diagram vertex <i>s</i> is the source and the
vertex <i>t</i> is the sink or destination. The capacity of each
edge is shown alongside the edge.As the edge from <i>s</i> to
<i>v</i><sub>1</sub> has the capacity of 16.</p>
<p>Now the possible flows paths from the source to destination can
be:</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/6658c581aa6d55349a52d007a819b0155f0bea7a.png"></p>
<p>There might be a few more flow paths as well. The maximum flow
possible through a path is equal to the minimum capacity of an
edge. For example in the first flow path<img src=
"../imgs/cc609fe111c760f876937144022e3d2c019a817f.png">, the
maximum flow would be12.</p>
<p>A <b>cut</b> in a network is the set of network edges that, when
removed from the network stop the flow of data from the source to
sink. Amongst the set of cuts the one that has the minimum capacity
is known as the <b>minimum cut</b>.</p>
<p>A flow network has various applications in practicality. It is
used in data warehouses, scientific research and electricity
distribution etc.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">
<p>To find the minimum cut with least amount of edges the
<b>Maximum Flow Minimum Cut</b> theorem can be used.</p>
<p>This theorem says that in a flow network, the maximum quantity
of flow going from source to sink will be always equal to the least
or minimum quantity which when discarded in a particular way from
the network creates the condition that neither of the flow can go
through from the source to the sink.</p>
<p><b>For example</b>:</p>
<p>In the above graph the possible cuts are:</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/99676ee9742853a07b381f4bf66da800525fc542.png"></p>

alt="C:\Users\evelyn 16\Desktop\CDR TIP\12.tif"></p>
<p>Removal of any of the given set of edges would leave the network
disconnected and reaching destination from source would not be
possible either way.</p>
<p>In the possible cuts of the above network the cut<img src=
"../imgs/c712e4c5b825adac934a10342d7750330ecb10ea.png">has the
least capacity and that is<img src=
"../imgs/a649ce459b79a8dd9b495657ec771801edb173db.png">. The edge
<i>v</i><sub>2</sub><i>v</i><sub>1</sub> is assigned acapacity 0
because that is in the reverse direction of <i>sv</i><sub>2</sub>
and <i>v</i><sub>1</sub><i>v</i><sub>3</sub>.</p>

modifying the cut in <i>G</i> is as:</p>
<p>? Try to find a minimum cut in the graph <i>G</i> with a changed
variable;</p>
<p>? The fundamental to be applied here is as the cost incurred in
a cut is equal to the total capacity moving through the cut, for
this change the graph by adding up a new edge from every node in
the graph to <i>t</i> that have capacity one.</p>
<p>? The above line or method implies that each node in the same
region of cut as <i>s</i>will provide one extra cost to the total
cost of the cut.</p>
<p>? As the edges from that particular node to <i>t</i> would be go
through that edge.</p>

<div class="answer">
<p><b>Mathematical manipulation:</b></p>
<p>Suppose there are two cuts <img src=
"../imgs/1e8a83ead6b448841eea47ff4a3222d92d970fd0.png"> and
<img src="../imgs/bac6db05ec7adab40f56974178ba4c9a8a5ef6a2.png">in
the first graph <i>G</i> and <i><img src=

be their respective capacities. Because <i>G’</i> is the enhanced
graph made by using <i>G</i> so this will have the same cuts as
<i>G</i>has.</p>
<p>Now, it is known that every edge has got an addition of d in the
capacity.</p>
<p>So, the total capacity of the cut would be increased by
<i>d</i>.</p>
<p>So,</p>
<p><img src=

<p>If <img src=

contradiction of consideration. This will be always true regardless
how many edges are there in the cut.</p>
<p>So, the minimum cut owning least number of edges in <i>G’</i>
would be the minimum cut with least number of edges in
<i>G</i>.</p>
<p>Now, choosing the value of <i>d</i> carefully is important.
Suppose, in <i>G</i>, the difference between the capacities of two
cuts is <i>x</i>.</p>
<p>So,</p>

<p>The capacity can only be positive. So, <i>x</i> can be any
positive number. The simplest value would be 1 and all the edges
can be doubled to yield the below given result:</p>
