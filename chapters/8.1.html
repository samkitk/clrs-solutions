sorting algorithm is <img src=

<p>Suppose that <i>A</i> be the sequence which is having the
<i>n</i> number of elements. This sequence is divided into the
subsequence of length <i>k</i> that is <i>n/k</i> for each of
length <i>k</i> and in any subsequence, all the elements are
greater than the all elements of the earlier subsequence. In any
subsequence, all the elements are smaller than the all of the
elements of the subsequent subsequence.</p>
<p>Now to show that <img src=
"../imgs/65f727eca8e8224b869d624a62d422125bf058ca.png"> is the
lower bound on the comparison, it is needed to solve the specified
variant of sorting problem.</p>
<p>• First of all consider a decision tree of given height <i>h</i>
for the comparison sort for sequence <i>A</i>. As the elements of
the every subsequence may be in any order, therefore any of the
<i>k!</i> Correspond to the last and final sorted order of the
subsequence.</p>
<p>• As there are the <i>n/k</i> subsequence, so each of that may
in any order and there are the total <img src=
"../imgs/de4083b67ac4e02dc500d13b5ac19bafa187306f.png">permutation
of <i>A</i> which can be crossponding to sorting of some input
order. Hence, for sorting of sequence <i>A</i>, any decision tree
must have the number of leaves at least<img src=
"../imgs/de4083b67ac4e02dc500d13b5ac19bafa187306f.png">.</p>
<p>• Any binary tree with the height of <i>h</i> does not have more
than <i>2</i><sup>h</sup> leaves, so it can be concluded that
<img src="../imgs/1fee3d579f5ff1c1b114883d22debb57684e1e11.png">or
by taking the logarithms, and it can be write as:<img src=
"../imgs/48b2cef8c2a305309b97c6bb0435ab4fbdc780ec.png">.</p>
<p>• Now the equation <img src=
"../imgs/48b2cef8c2a305309b97c6bb0435ab4fbdc780ec.png"> can be
solved further to get the result as:</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/60b528e47d34d9fe48b709910822fc79d25e925e.png"></p>
<p>• Now, it can solved or write as <img src=
"../imgs/b1894b2df802fefe480cd1c0de1d699fc7c84c94.png"> because
<i>k!</i> is having the <i>k/2</i> as its largest terms being at
least for <i>k/2</i> each (refer exercise 8.1.2 solution).</p>
<p>This equation can be further solve as:</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/ca6873f3b4e59ee5f42cf2aaf8ddf009a1786e57.png"></p>
<p>Thus, lower bound on the number of comparisons needed to solve
the specified variant for sorting problem is<img src=
