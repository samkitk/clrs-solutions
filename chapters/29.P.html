<p>A linear program is generally a maximization or minimization
problem and there can be either equations or the inequalities for
the constraints.</p>
<p>Various algorithms are there for solving the linear programs,
among them the most standard algorithm is the SIMPLEX algorithm. It
generally has a fast running time. There is also algorithm whose
running time is in polynomial, as ELLIPSOID algorithm. It is slower
in practice.</p>
<p>Here to show that the algorithm for linear program can be used
to solve the linear inequalities feasibility problem; consider the
ELLIPSOID algorithm, it can be used to solve the feasibility
problem. The notion is to have a big ellipse, that is the ellipse
in the higher dimension. It must lie in the feasible region. Then
we will test that the ellipse violates any constraint or not.</p>
<p>If there is no violation then the work is done. But if there is
violation then look for it.</p>
<p>So in this way it is possible to know that the solution lies in
the ellipse. And this step is repeated to create a smaller ellipse
and so on. It has an advantage that you only have to show that the
current solution violates the constraints or not.</p>
<p>So, if there is an algorithm for linear program, it can be used
to solve the <b>Linear Inequality Feasibility Problem.</b></p>

<p><b>Integer Linear Programming</b></p>
<p><b>Linear Programming:</b></p>
<p>Linear programming is a way of achieving the maximum possible
outcome from a set of resources that are represented as an
integrated mathematical design.</p>
<p>In the technical terms, the linear programming is a way to
achieve optimum results from the linear programming problems. This
optimization is subject to a few constraints.</p>
<p>A linear program is commonly in the below given form:</p>
<p>In a standard form for a linear program, there is a set of
<i>p</i> real numbers that are<img src=
"../imgs/39785c7b620b878141a51ec61f2526d3b388cec6.png">, another
set of <i>q</i> real numbers that are<img src=

of<img src=

<p><img src=

<p>Now the objective is to find <i>p</i> real numbers<img src=
"../imgs/55db0d03d80e4b3031f1947950493a0acbeeb709.png">such
that</p>

<p>The first expression is called the objective function. The
second and the third expression show the constraints.</p>
<p><b>Integer Programming:</b></p>
<p>This is just like a linear program with an extra rule. In this
the variable are allowed to take only integer values. With this
constraint, this programming is also known as the Mixed Integer
Liner Programming (MILP). Many, but not all of the conditions that
are true for the common linear programming, do hold for the Mixed
Integer Linear Programming.</p>
<p>In the general form the integer program can be expressed as:</p>
<p>Minimize</p>
<p><img src=

Various integer programs include: Assignment problem, Minimum
Spanning- tree problem, Product-mix problem and so many; it is more
difficult to solve the integer linear program than to solve the
normal linear program. It is a NP-hard problem it means that the
problem cannot be solve in a polynomial time.</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">
<p><i><b>a.</b></i></p>
<p>Here, to show the weak duality for the integer linear program;
as in the question, lemma (29.8) should be referred to.</p>
<p>The theorem defines that the objective function of any linear
program that is in its primal form is always bounded for its upper
limit by the objective function of its dual form. The value of the
objective function for the primal form is always smaller than or
equal to the value of the objective function for the dual form.</p>
<p>Considering the standard form of the linear programming there
are <img src=

program is called as the primal. Dual for any linear program is
just an image of the primal form of it. If the dual is found for a
linear program that is already in the dual form, it yields the
primal form of itself.</p>
<p>The dual form can be expressed mathematically as:</p>

<p>In order to form the dual the maximizationis altered to

<p><img src=

Hence the required lemma is proved and it illustrates that theweak
duality holds for the integer linear program.</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">
<p><i><b>b.</b></i></p>
<p>It is to be shown that the duality does not always hold for the
integer linear program. For the duality theorem refer to the
section 29.4 of the textbook.</p>
<p>The simple statement representing the duality theorem is as
below:</p>
<p>If there is an optimal solution for the primal form of the
linear program and so does for the dual form of the linear program,
then the values of the objective function of both of the primal
program and dual form would be equal.</p>
<p>Considerthe issue:</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/2ac29bc12ff8784378a1ab0fcadb684e0ac31d33.png"></p>
<p>They will form a weak dual pair if</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/3090cf6dd78459ae3ac6d3aa2e96bb2c03879141.png">For all
<img src="../imgs/c89297c561dac8081e0cbef4e4ece0a9ae18612f.png">
and <img src=
"../imgs/70f4bdcded3c12b8b45db3ec3c41177584d109f7.png"></p>
<p>When the condition <i>a</i>=<i>b</i> is fulfilled there would be
a strong dual pair. And the proposition that</p>
<p><img src="../imgs/f7c521a70dc83dd44d649d3ddc694e7ef6a2b7fc.png">
And the linear program</p>
<img src="../imgs/5a537fb77c1c6f225f1fe712e54f2d18775683ee.png">
Forms a pair of weak-dual problem So it shows that the weak duality
hold for the integer linear program but it is not true for the
strong duality. Hence the condition for duality in the integer
linear programming does not hold.</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">
<p><i><b>c.</b></i></p>
<p>In the given problem, there is an assumption that the both the
primal integer and the dual integer program are both feasible and
bounded. And various variables are used as:</p>
<p>1. P: - optimal objective value of primal of the linear
program.</p>
<p>2. D: - optimal objective value of dual of the linear
program.</p>
<p>3. IP: - optimal objective value of primal of the integer linear
program.</p>
<p>4. ID: - optimal objective value of dual of the integer linear
program.</p>
<p>In the previous sections both of the weak duality theorem and
the strong duality theorems have already been proven. So, with
reference to the theorem there holds the condition that:</p>
<p>1. As per the weak duality theorem of the linear programming the
value of the objective function for the dual always dominates the
value of the objective function of the primal form.</p>
<p>That is:</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/9591e2c41d5155c0d7a84d9f241cbd6baf58d415.png">.</p>
<p>2. According to the strong duality theorem solutions of primal
form of the linear program and dual form of the same linear program
are optimal only when their values are equal.</p>
<p>That is:</p>
<p><img src="../imgs/928aa2c1c6b1cbec31d8cfd73cb97d5b461a381c.png">
<b>... … (1)</b></p>
<p>Here the solution is feasible so, the given relation is obtained
by the using the above specified theorem</p>
<p>Using the weak duality theorem,</p>
<p><img src="../imgs/5d78c06ad1ae2c3d1e6fa0fef87099cad8007c97.png">
<b>… …</b> <b>(2)</b></p>
<p>Now as the integer programming takes only the integer values the
optimal solutions for the integer solution would be less in amount.
From here, the conclusion that the primal form of the linear
programming would be greater than the primal form of the integer
program and the dual for the linear program would be smaller than
dual of the integer program.</p>

<p><b>Minimum Cost Circulation</b></p>
<p>For a better understanding of a minimum cost circulation,
knowledge of various terms used in it must be known such as
network, circulation etc., to illustrate which, assume a network
having a source and a link. The network consists of various
nodes.</p>
<p>A flow network is nothing but a directed graph of vertices and
edges. Each of the graph edge has a capacity. The capacity defines
the data value that can be moved through that edge.</p>
<p>The capacity is always greater than 0. One more thing is that if
there is an edge going from a vertex <i>v</i><sub>1</sub> to vertex
<i>v</i><sub>2</sub> then no edge can go from <i>v</i><sub>2</sub>
to <i>v</i><sub>1</sub>.</p>
A flow which is balanced at each node of the network is termed as a
circulation. The cost of the circulation is identified with the
cost of flow in the network. Minimum cost circulation is to be
dealt with, here. It is a circulation which has the smallest
possible cost in the network. In the network, there is no
restriction on the network flow. Similar to the flow networks,
minimum cost circulation problem must abide by the flow and
capacity constraint for the network.</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer"><b>For example</b>, If the cost along all the
networks is positive, then there will be no flow in all the edges.
However if there is a negative cost cycles in the network then
there will be a flow in the edges.</div>

Here, the constraints <b>(2)</b> are the <b>flow conservation
constraints</b>. The total amount of flow and entering of the nodes

conservation constraint expects that the outgoing flow less the

the flow ranges between the lower and the upper bound.</div>

<div class="answer"><i><b>b.</b></i> <b>To find the</b> <b>optimal

(<i>u</i>, <i>v</i>)&gt;0. An optimal solution for this
minimum-cost circulation is to be found. Consider a circulation

shows that in the decomposition, at least one of the cycles has to
be negative. So the <img src=
"../imgs/a70b1ef6615e59e8447e23cb39b40cfd85dd78b7.png"> contains a

<p><i><b>c.</b></i> <b>To find the Maximum Flow Problem as Minimum

<p>So an edge <img src=

<p>Now define the cost of the edges in the maximum-flow problem

<p><img src=

<p>The capacities on the edge <img src=

that<img src=

that the direction of flow is from <i>t</i> to <i>s</i>.</p>
<p>So there is one-to-one correspondence between the circulations
in the new graph and the flow in the original graph <i>G</i>. This
correspondence satisfies all the flow conservation constraints
in<img src=
