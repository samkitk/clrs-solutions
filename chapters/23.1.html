<p>Consider the Theorem <i>23.1</i> (refer chapter 23, section 23.1
of textbook) statement.</p>
<p>Professor Sabatier gives the converse of this theorem and states
that <i>(u, v)</i> is the light edge for the cut. The assumption of
the professor is false. The reasons are given below:</p>
<p>• Consider the safe edge <i>A</i>. The safe edge definition says
that when any edge is added to the set of edges <i>A</i>, then the
resultant subset will also have some minimum spanning tree.</p>
<p>• This particular specification about the safe edge does not
provide the reference of light edge in any way.</p>
<p><img src="../imgs/3c725a496878f2753293dbe886d3b2f6d76f3d02.png"
alt=
"D:\2015 FILES\MONTHS 2015\9 September\25.9.2015\Kuldeep 2254\Image\1.png"></p>
<p>• For the situation from a counter example, there may be many
numbers of safe edges from the <i>S to V-S</i> but it is not
possible to have all edge to be light. Consider the above figure as
the counter example: <i>V=</i> {<i>P, Q, R, S, T,
U</i>}<i>.</i></p>
<p>• Suppose <i>S=</i>{<i>P,Q,R</i>}<i>,</i> and
<i>A=</i>{<i>(P,Q), (Q,R)</i>}. From the above diagram, it can be
see that edges <i>(P,S), (Q,T)</i> and <i>(R,U)</i> all are safe
edges, but only edge <i>(R,T)</i> is the light edge for the cut.
Hence assumption of the professor is false.</p>
<p><b>Therefore, the above example proves that the Professor
Sabatier’s conjectured converse theorem is incorrect.</b></p>

<p>There are the following steps to show that, there is the minimum
spanning tree (MST) of <i>G</i> which does not contain <i>e</i> on
the basis of provided specification:</p>
<p>• Consider that T is define as the minimum spanning tree (MST)
of G’ which is define as<img src=
"../imgs/7ec9e370c8310acd30497cbb66dd010159d23d79.png">. Suppose
that <i>u</i> and <i>v</i> are define as the two vertices which is
adjacent to the edge <i>e</i>, edge e is the maximum weight edge on
the some cycle of<img src=
"../imgs/5f3845b9b0e0e921249108c97745862f3f4d2201.png">.</p>
<p>• If Edge e <i>is</i> added to the graph <i>G</i>’ then it will
produce the graph <i>G</i>. If <i>T</i> is define as the MST of
some cycle of graph <i>G</i><sup>’</sup> then it is also a spanning
tree of some cycle of graph <i>G</i> as the only both contains the
same vertices, only the difference exist between both is of edge
<i>e</i>.</p>
<p>• T is spanning tree of graph <i>G</i>, but is it the MST of
graph <i>G</i>? Assume that <i>T</i> is not the MST of graph
<i>G</i>. if this is happened then this would be lead a
conflictness.</p>
<p>• Now, if <i>T</i> is not defined as the MST of some cycle of
graph <i>G</i> then there should be a <i>T</i><sup>’</sup> tree
which should be minimum spanning tree of <i>G</i><sup>’</sup> with
less than weight of <i>G</i> and it will have the edge
<i>e</i>.</p>
<p>• Since MST <i>T</i><sup>’</sup> is exist as the MST of graph
<i>G</i><sup>’</sup><sup>,</sup> and difference between both
<i>G</i> and <i>G</i><sup>’</sup> is of <i>e</i> edge then MST
<i>T</i><sup>’</sup> and MST <i>T</i> will have common number of
edge equal to the n-2. It is so because a simple tree of
<i>n</i>-vertices has <i>n-1</i> edge. And ending edge in MST
<i>T</i><sup>’</sup> is <i>e</i> edge.</p>
<p>• Assume that <i>e</i><sup>’</sup> edge be the ending edge for
the MST <i>T</i>. As the weight of the maximum edge <i>e</i> is
more than the weight of the maximum edge <i>e</i><sup>’</sup>, so
MST <i>T</i><sup>’</sup> cannot be the MST after all, which is the
contradiction.</p>
<p>Therefore, T is the minimum spanning tee for the both G and

<p>A tree is defined as the connected undirected graph without the
cycle or circuit. Graph is the collection of the nodes or vertices
and edges that connect the nodes. Graph is categories into
different categories:</p>
<p>• A directed graph said to be the strongly connected graph if
for all vertices <i>v, w</i> there exist a path from the <i>v</i>
to <i>w</i> and also a path from the <i>w</i> to <i>v</i>. If any
graph does not follow the property of the strongly connected graph
then it said to be the weekly connected graph.</p>
<p>• An undirected graph said to be a tree if there is exist only a
unique path between the graph vertices. In the mesh network each
node is connected to the other in the network.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">
<p>In any graph in which edges are associated with some numerical
value then graph is called as weighted graph. Normally the edge
weights are the non-negative integers. Weight of the edges are
oftenly referred as the cost of edges.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">
<p>There are the following condition steps for conclusion to argue
that if weights of the all edges in a graph are the positive then
any subset of the edges which connects the all vertices and having
minimum total length must be define as tree:</p>
<p>• A graph which contains only non-negative weights, the subset
of graph edges that connects the all vertices must be acyclic as
the cycle by the definition contains the at least single edge which
can be removed without changing the connectivity of subset
graph.</p>
<p>• Suppose a graph is define as <i>G</i> and a minimum graph
which contains the cycle is define as <i>g</i>. Consider, if
someone remove the cycle or the remove the redundant edge from the
graph <i>g</i> then it is called as <i>g</i><sup>’</sup>.</p>
<p>• Now as the one edge is remove from the graph g then the weight
of the graph <i>g</i><sup>’</sup> will be less than the weight of
the graph <i>g</i> or it can be written as<img src=
"../imgs/614d4e353aae410b70755191791e9308fbd97be0.png">.</p>
<p>• But for argument, <i>g</i> cannot be the minimum weight graph.
So the subset graph created by the edge connecting of all vertices
in such a way that the weight must be minimum for the acyclic.</p>
<p>In the same manner, it can be display that subgraph does not
contain the cross edge. These are the condition for the Graph
<i>G</i> defining as minimum spanning tree because graph <i>G</i>
is cycle which contains the all vertices and if this is directed
graph then it will not contain any cross edge.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">
<p>Though, above defined conditions not holed for a negative
weighted tree. Consider the following example which shows that
calculated conclusion based on the condition is false for the
negative weight.</p>

<p>In the above graph, if it have cycle which is formed in the way
of P to Q, Q to T and T to P. The minimum in such a case is
unidentified because minimum can be randomly increase by looping
the edge of P to S that decrease of the total weight of path in
every loop.</p>

<p>A spanning tree is the sub graph of the graph that contains the
all vertices to define a tree. A graph may contains the one or more
than one spanning tree.</p>
<p>• A minimum spanning tree (MST) is defined as weighted graph
<i>G</i> of the spanning tree, in which the sum of edges is equal
to the minimum weight.</p>
<p>• Basically the Minimum spanning tree has the following
properties: It contains the each vertex in graph. And the weighted
sum of the all edges should be minimum.</p>
<p>• To find the minimum spanning tree, there are various types of
algorithm is exist such as Kruskal and Prims algorithm in graph
theory and data structure.</p>
<p>• Kruskal's algorithm is used to find the MST from a graph <i>G
(V, E).</i> Here <i>V</i> is the set of vertices and <i>E</i> is
the set of edges. A spanning tree of a graph <i>G (V, E</i>) is
subgraph of <i>G</i> having all the vertices of <i>G</i> but
contains no cycle. MST of a graph is one which total cost should be
minimum.</p>
<p>• To find the MST (Suppose <i>T</i> is the final MST) of a
weighted (<i>w</i>) graph <i>G (V, E)</i> following are the
algorithm steps:</p>
<p><i>MST-KRUSKAL (G, w)</i></p>
<p>1. // define initially to be empty set.</p>
<p><i>T=φ;</i></p>
<p>2. For each vertex <i>v</i> <i>??</i> <i>G, V,</i> Make empty
set out of <i>v</i>.</p>
<p><i>MAKE-SET (v);</i></p>
<p>3. Sort the edges of G, E in increasing order by weight
<i>w</i>;</p>
<p>4. For each edge (u, v) ?? G.E, taken from incremental order or
sorted list.</p>
<p>// If both edge are belongs to the different set</p>
<p><i>FIND-SET (u) ≠ FIND-SET (v);</i></p>
<p>// add the edge (u, v) to the tree T;</p>
<p><img src="../imgs/b409040402dc4ed3dec92d757ae34a4098dd76a6.png">
<i>s</i></p>
<p>// Put the u and v in the one single set;</p>
<p><i>UNION (u, v);</i></p>
<p>5. return <i>T</i></p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">
<p>Assume that <i>T</i> is MST of graph <i>G</i> and <i>L</i> is
the sorted list of the graph edges with respect to the weight in
tree <i>T</i>. To show that for the any other MST
<i>T</i><sup>’</sup> of graph <i>G</i>, the sorted list <i>L</i>
will be same in <i>T</i><sup>’</sup><i>,</i> following steps need
to be considered:</p>
<p>• Consider the following graph with the weighted edge. Kruskal
algorithms will find the MST in the sorted order.</p>

alt=
"D:\2015 FILES\MONTHS 2015\9 September\25.9.2015\Kuldeep 2254\Image\3.png"></p>
<p>• Suppose that based on the Kruskal algorithm, the minimum
spanning tree <i>T</i> in the specified order <i>L</i> is
calculated as shown below:</p>
<p><img src="../imgs/5088e40f989cd07731c63b3f47d592951c98445a.png"
alt=
"D:\2015 FILES\MONTHS 2015\9 September\25.9.2015\Kuldeep 2254\Image\4.png"></p>
<p>• If <i>T</i><sup>’</sup> is minimum spanning tree then it can
be found out in the similar way from the Kruskal algorithm in the
specified sorted order <i>L</i><sup>’</sup> which is shown as
below:</p>
<p><img src="../imgs/3f2fb84dd94acce7fa380a511a3127289b060f82.png"
alt=
"D:\2015 FILES\MONTHS 2015\9 September\25.9.2015\Kuldeep 2254\Image\5.png"></p>
<p>• Now if the specified sorted order <i>L</i> and <i>L</i>’ for
the both minimum spanning tree are not equivalent or <img src=
"../imgs/d6433bd4b11388535d510dabb95d1b75fbdfec56.png"> then it
shows the contradiction because if they differ at any point then
Kruskal algorithm have to pick the smaller of the two.</p>
<p>• So to obtain the <i>L</i><sup>’</sup> is impossible as from
the above calculated minimum spanning tree, it is shown that:</p>
<p>For <i>T</i>, sorted order list <i>L= {1, 2};</i></p>
<p>For <i>T</i><sup>’</sup>, sorted order list <i>L= {1,
2}.</i></p>

<p>A minimum spanning tree (MST) is defined as weighted graph G of
the spanning tree, in which the sum of edges is equal to the
minimum weight. Basically the Minimum spanning tree has the

following steps:</p>
<p>1. List all the edge of graph in increasing order.</p>
<p>2. Select smallest edge from the list and add to the spanning

<p>According to the provided specification, <i>T</i> is the minimum
spanning tree (MST) of the graph <i>G= (V, E)</i> and
<i>V</i><sup>’</sup> is define as the subset of set of vertices
<i>V</i>. To proof that if subgraph <i>T</i><sup>’</sup> of
<i>T</i> is connected then it will be a MST, there are the
following steps:</p>
<p>• It is assumed that <i>T</i><sup>’</sup> is the subgraph of
<i>T</i> which is persuaded by the <i>V</i><sup>’</sup> and
<i>G</i><sup>’</sup> is the subgraph of <i>G</i> which is made by
the <i>V</i><sup>’</sup>.</p>

weighted spanning tree for the graph G<sup>’</sup>. Let’s suppose
that graph <i>G</i><sup>’</sup> have a minimum weighted spanning
tree <i>A</i><sup>’</sup>.</p>
<p>• If someone merged subset of the edges <i>T\T</i><sup>’</sup>
to the minimum spanning tree <i>S</i><sup>’</sup> then it will
produce the spanning tree <i>S</i> for the graph <i>G</i>.</p>
<p>• Now weight of tree <i>S</i> would be minimum as compare to the
weight of tree <i>T</i>. and this produce the contradiction that

<p>For given a graph <i>G</i> and a MST <i>T</i>, someone reduce
the weight of the any one edge in MST <i>T</i> then <i>T</i> will
still the MST for the graph <i>G</i>. There are the following steps
with respect to this proof:</p>
<p>• Suppose in minimum spanning tree <i>T, {E</i><sub>1</sub><i>,
E</i><sub>2</sub><i>, E</i><sub>3</sub><i>…
E</i><sub>n-1</sub><i>}</i> be the set of edges with their
respected weight of {L<sub>1</sub><i>, L</i><sub>2</sub><i>,

which is known as <img src=

<p>• Now assume the opposite of the proof means if weight

the <img src=

of the edge <i>E</i><sup>’</sup>.</p>
