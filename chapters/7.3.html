<p>There is a difference between deterministic algorithms and
randomized algorithms in calculating running time. A deterministic
algorithm may have best, worst and average case running times. But
a randomized algorithm only have expected (or average case) running
time.</p>
<p>• When a deterministic algorithm runs multiple times with the
same input, the running time is same in all executions. Because the
running time of a deterministic algorithm depends on the input
provided.</p>
<p>• Unlike deterministic algorithms, a randomized algorithm makes
random choices while running. Thus when the random algorithm is run
multiple times with the same input, the number of steps executed on
each execution may vary.</p>
<p>• Therefore the running time of a random algorithm does not
depend on input, but on random choices that the algorithm made.</p>
<p>• Thus, regarding randomized algorithms, there is no case of
best case inputs and worst case inputs. But, the random algorithm
may choose any one of all possible permutations of the input
equally likely.</p>
<p>• Thus, all running times for all possible permutations of input
are considered for running time calculation. This is equal to
average-case running time calculation.</p>
<p><b>Hence, for a randomized algorithm, only the expected (or
average-case) running time is calculated.</b></p>

<p>In case of average case behavior of the quicksort algorithm, the
analysis is done with the assumption that the partitioning is
completely random because every permutation of the input numbers is
equally likely.</p>
<p>However, in practice, the partitioning isn’t as random as
expected. So, in order to obtain the expected performance,
randomization can be incorporated. In order to do this, replace the
call to PARTITION procedure with a call to the RANDOMIZED-PARTITION
procedure. The RANDOMIZED-PARTITION is turn calls the RANDOM
procedure.</p>
<p>So, the call to the RANDOM procedure is done once each time a
call to the RANDOMIZED-PARTITION is made. Therefore, the number of
calls to procedure RANDOM is same as the number of calls to the
RANDOMIZED-PARTITION procedure. So, consider the number of
RANDOMIZED-PARTITION calls to determine the total number of calls
to the procedure, RANDOM.</p>
<p><b>Assumption made for this instance of the problem:</b> It is
assumed that the elements are all distinct from each other. If they
are not distinct and all are same, then no call to the RANDOM
procedure is needed at all. And thus, it defeats the purpose of
finding the number of calls needed for best case scenario.</p>
<p>The total size of the input list is<img src=

<p><b>Worst Case:</b> The worst case in case of quicksort occur
when the partition returns a sub-list of size 0 and another
sub-list of size<img src=

<p>The partitioning itself takes care of one element which becomes
the pivot element.</p>
<p>Then the RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT is called recursively on both
these lists independently.</p>
<p>So, the following recurrence relation determines the number of
calls made to the RADOM procedure (which is inside the
RANDOMIZED-PARTITION procedure):</p>
<p><img src=

<p>To do this partition, one pivot element is chosen using the
RANDOMIZED-PARTITION procedure. This process takes care of one
element. This is just one call done in constant time.</p>

<p>The following observations are made on the above recurrence
relation:</p>
<p>• The initial size of the problem is <i>n.</i></p>
<p>• The size of the problem decreases by 1 each time.</p>
<p>• Constant cost <img src=
"../imgs/bd9a30aadee6b053c77ced961bc48e638e1d3b39.png"> is required
for division of the problem at each stage.</p>
<p>Thus, to completely eliminate the problem, the problem needs to
be subdivided <i>n</i> times. And each time incurs<img src=
