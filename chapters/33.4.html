<p><b>Scheme of Checking only 5 Points Instead of 7 in Closest Pair
Algorithm</b></p>
Closest pair algorithm is used to find the length between two
points such that the measured length <img src=
"../imgs/ae7146962ade0e0301eb8d7d6a14c9a9fecb4ad4.png"> is minimum
length. In this algorithm, the divide and conquer approach is used
that is the point set <i>P</i> is divided into two parts
<i>P</i><sub>L</sub> and <i>P</i><sub>R</sub> by a straight
vertical line whose <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates of points are
stored in the arrays <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> in the sorted order.
Consider the figure given below:</div>

<hr>
<div class="answer">Now, it is to be checked if there is any pair
of points with less than <img src=
"../imgs/ae7146962ade0e0301eb8d7d6a14c9a9fecb4ad4.png"> distance
between them and one point is on the left of line and the other one
is on the right side of line. For this, an array <i>Y’</i> is
created which stores the points which are at the distance less than
<img src="../imgs/af92b1b9282cc835d1bd366f6d6023bc577b6d56.png"> in
which at most 8 points can reside in the rectangle <img src=
"../imgs/a336f5006bf43717f98b9c9dd484789d7bfc381b.png">. So for
each point <i>p</i>, minimum 7 points are checked for minimum
distance.</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">Professor Williams came up with the idea of
checking only 5 points in the array <i>Y’</i>. This idea came from
the fact that the points will reside on the line <i>l</i> into set
<i>P</i><sub>l</sub>. In this condition residing one point in
<i>P</i><sub>L</sub> and other in <i>P</i><sub>R</sub> does not
matter at all. Thus maximum 6 points can be there in
rectangle<img src=
"../imgs/a336f5006bf43717f98b9c9dd484789d7bfc381b.png">.</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">To justify this, first consider the above
diagram which has a line <i>l</i> and two dotted lines, one in the
left of <i>l</i> and another one inright to <i>l</i>. Both of them
are locatedto <i>l</i> at a distance of delta. This area makes a
region same as rectangle but in closest pair algorithm analysis 8
points are considered which lie in this reason. Equal number of
points lie in these regions that are 4 and 4.</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">One consideration is “no point lie on the line
<i>l</i>” but according to professor, if one point is on the line
for both the region, then total number of points would become 6
because left and right regions have equal number of points so here,
the point on the line would be counted in both of the
regions.</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">In earlier approach, there are 8 points in that
rectangle and no point lie on the line <i>l</i> but according to
professor approach 1 point for both the region lies on that line
<i>l</i> which makes count 6 in case of comparison because minimum
distance formula gives the length in horizontal way, not in the
vertical way. So, according to professor, one point has to be
compared with 5 other points.</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">
<p>In the closest pair problem, the assumption is made that in
rectangle<img src=
"../imgs/a336f5006bf43717f98b9c9dd484789d7bfc381b.png">, there will
be 8 points that is 4 in the left <img src=
"../imgs/09bb9fb746e7dcc004849320a08638996e23d451.png">square
<i>P</i><sub>L</sub> and 4 points in the right square
<i>P</i><sub>R</sub> and there is no point on the line.</p>
<p>According to the idea given by Professor Williams on the closest
pair problem, the points on the right side of left square and the
points on the left side of right square are same that is two points
are reduced. Now, there are total 6 points and for every point
<i>p</i>, only 5 points have to be checked to find the closest
pair.</p>
<p>So, only 5 points reside in the array <i>Y’</i> and it saves
number of points that are checked every time reducefrom 7 to 5.
This approach does exactly what closest pair finding approach with
7 points is supposed to do with less number of comparisons in each
recursion.</p>
<p>Thus, this technique is subtle and there is no flaw in it.A
simple thing that can be observed in this illustration is that the
professor’s idea is all about the reduction of the size of the
problem, but to change the basic strategy that is used to solve the
problem.</p>
<p>Hence, Professor Williams’ scheme of checking only 5 points
instead of 7 in the array <i>Y’</i> works enough appropriately for
the closest pair problem.</p>

<p><b>Efficiency of Checking only 5 Points Instead of 7 in Closest

<p>Consider the closest pair algorithm which is used to find the

<p>The <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates of points of left and
right side of line are stored in <i>X</i><sub>L</sub>,
<i>X</i><sub>R</sub> and <i>Y</i><sub>L</sub>,

is in the right of line.</p>
<p>For this an array <i>Y’</i> is created which stores the points
which are at the distance less than <img src=

check only 5 points following <i>p</i> in the array <i>Y’</i>.</p>

<p>In the closest pair problem the assumption is made that in
rectangle <img src=

elements which lies in the rectangle<img src=

in the right side of left square and the points in the left side of
right hand square are same that is two points are reduced.</p>
<p>Now, there are total 6 points and for every point <i>p</i> it is
required to check only 5 points to find the closest pair. So, only
6 points reside in the array <i>Y’</i> and it saves the number of
points that are checked every time from 7 to 5. Thus, it is
sufficient to check only 5 points in the array <i>Y’.</i></p>

<div class="answer">
<p>Consider the 33.4-1 of this text book, To justify this, first
consider the above diagram which has a line <i>l</i> and two dotted
lines one is left of <i>l</i> and another one right to <i>l</i>
both are away to <i>l</i> at a distance of delta.</p>
<p>This area makes a region same as rectangle, but in closest pair
algorithm analysis, consider 8 points which lie on this reason and
equal number of points lies in this region, that is, 4 and 4.</p>
<p>One consideration is that “no point lies on the line <i>l</i>”
but according to professor, if one point is on the line for both
the regions then total number of points would become 6 because left
and right regions have equal number of points so here, both points
count on both the region.</p>
<p>In earlier approach if there are 8 points in that rectangle and
no point lies on the line <i>l</i> but according to the professor’s
approach 1 points for both the region lies on that line <i>l</i>
which makes count 6 in case of comparison because minimum distance
formula gives the length in horizontal way not in vertical way.</p>
<p>So, according to professor, one point has to be compared with
other 5 points. Hence, it actually suffices to check only 5 points
in the array <i>Y’</i> in closest pair problem for every point in

<p>In all the three cases, minimum distance has been taken into
consideration and is returned by the algorithm.</p>
<p>The Euclidean formula for finding the distance between two
points is given below:</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/f3f68fd3b30202d625235fcca025e075eb93a6af.png"></p>
<p>Since all the points are co-vertical, the difference between the

<p>The distance between two points is equal to the difference
between their <i>y</i>-coordinates.</p>
<p>Here, the complexity of the closest pair algorithm remains same
as changes has no effect on the running time. The reason is that
the recurrence relation is directly same as final value of relation
or complexity of the closest pair algorithm.</p>
<p>The calculation of extra <i>n</i> is not considered because
points are co-vertical (points have constant <i><b>x</b></i>

<p>The rest of the procedure remains the same as simple closest

<p>Now from the above explanation, in earlier method, <i>Y</i>
array is being pre-sorted and this array has the element of

<p>• The options available are (1) sort the array <i>Y</i> in
efficient time or (2) apply the merge sort. With the merge sort
concept, merge the two sorted arrays to form a final sorted
array.</p>
<p>• So, here those two sorted arrays are <i>Y</i><sub>L</sub> and
<i>Y</i><sub>R</sub> which are going to be merged to form a sorted
array <i>Y</i> and the complexity of this process is same as the
merge sort which is optimal sorting method of algorithm that
is<img src=
