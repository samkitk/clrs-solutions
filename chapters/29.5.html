<p>Where<img src=

variables of the problem and values <img src=
"../imgs/1a643fe8aab546f2474beb1d695f630e7d0bdbc0.png"> are the
objective function coefficients.</p>
<p>Now here in the given question, it is to be discussed that the
bounding condition for simplex when its loop is replaced by the
initialize simplex.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">
<p><b>SIMPLEX procedure:</b></p>
<p>Before getting into the issue, a brief understanding of SIMPLEX
procedure is required. Refer to the section 29.3 of the text book
for the procedure,</p>
<p>The simplex procedure is useful in making the linear programs.
The procedure works on the linear programs that are represented in
their standard forms. The procedure takes the standard form of the
linear program as the input and yields an <i>n</i> vector <img src=
"../imgs/292b1f7604d6cd75fd8ea8532a64a0ff231a3633.png"> and that is
one of the optimal remedies to the concerned linear program.</p>
<p>This procedure is specifically helpful when more than one
decision variables are available. The procedure works as
follows:</p>
<p>The procedure first of all invokes the INITIALIZE-SIMPLEX (<i>A,
b, c</i>) procedure in line 1. This finds out if the linear program
is viable. If not, the linear program is stored in its slack form.
In the third line a loop is initialized.</p>
<p>If all of the coefficients in the concerned objective function
of the linear program are negative integers, the loop would
terminate. If not, the fourth line of the procedure selects a
variable that is <img src=
"../imgs/6a2b8aad8d2eca53d5219bffc3637080480f219c.png"> that has a
positive coefficient.</p>
<p>This will be made the entering variable for the procedure. This
variable is chosen using some predefined deterministic rule. Now
lines 5 to 9 check all of the constraints. This is meant for
getting the one that most vitally limits the amount by which
<img src="../imgs/6a2b8aad8d2eca53d5219bffc3637080480f219c.png">can
be extended with leaving the non-negativity constraint intact.</p>
<p>The variable associated with the non-negativity constraint
is<img src="../imgs/d4e009670ab180b2dbec50e96654bbf88b51cf5a.png">.
Now the leaving variable has to be chosen. Any random variable that
follows the predefined deterministic rule can be chosen to play the
leaving variable. If the quantity of increment in the entering
variable is not controlled by any of the available constraints the
line 11 returns “unbounded”.</p>
<p>If this is not true for the scenario, the line 12 of the
procedure swaps the entering variable and the leaving variable.
This is achieved by invoking the PIVOT procedure. Now the desired
solution of the given linear program is calculated using the line
13 to line 16 of the procedure.</p>
<p>Line 13 checks if the encountered variable is the basic or
non-basic. If this is basic, the appropriate value is accumulated
in the variable in line 15 and if this is not the basic variable
then set it to 0 in line 16. The last line of the procedure returns
the desired solution for the inputted linear program and that
is<img src=
"../imgs/cc634e73aa78005931309b4f305009d7002cbb91.png">.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">
<p><b>INITIALIZE-SIMPLEX procedure:</b></p>
<p>The procedure is used to find the basic feasible solution for
the problem. This procedure finds out the basic solution if the
program is feasible and returns that. If the program is not
feasible then the procedure creates a secondary solution and keeps
pivoting the secondary form till the time a feasible solution is
found.</p>
<p>Even after doing all this if no such solution for the problem is
found the procedure returns “infeasible”.</p>
<p>To understand the effect ofthis change a brief understanding of
the procedure INITIALIZE-SIMPLEX is required.</p>
<p><b>Explanation of the procedure:</b></p>
<p>The first three lines check for the basic solution of the linear
program. If the solution is found feasible, the slack form of the
program is returned.</p>
<p>If not, the secondary form of the solution is created. This
would not be feasible whatsoever. The reason is that the initial
solution of the basic form of the problem is not feasible.</p>
<p>Now to find a viable solution pivoting is performed. This is
done in the line 8. After pivoting the secondary form, the solution
for the problem is searched for. This results in a viable solution.
Now to find a complete feasible solution iterative invoke to PIVOT
is required till the optimal solution is found.</p>
<p>Once this is found the slack form of the program is found in
line 12 and line 13. This slack form is returned with the help of
line 15 of the procedure. Even after this if no feasible solution
is found for the program, the procedure returns “infeasible”.</p>
<p>So, altogether the procedure either finds a feasible solution
for the problem or it just returns infeasible.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">
<p><b>Effect of replacing the main loop with
INITIALIZE-SIMPLEX:</b></p>
<p>Now, it is to be checked what would happen if the main loop that
is “while” loop of the procedure, is run by a call to
INITIALIZE-SIMPLEX.</p>
<p>Suppose that a feasible solution for the linear program exists.
Now the initial call to INITIALIZE-SIMPLEX would return the slack
form of the linear program. The “While” loop in the SIMPLEX
procedure tries to find if this solution of the problem can be
bounded by some set of entering or leaving variables or not.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">INITIALIZE-SIMPLEX is intended to find a viable
solution for the program. There might be two cases.
<p><b>Case 1</b>: The procedure finds the viable solution for the
linear program and returns the slack form of the solution.</p>
<p><b>Case 2</b>: The procedure does not find any viable solution
for the linear program and returns “infeasible”.</p>
<p>So whenever the procedure would be called, there would be at
least some viable solution found for the program or there would be
no feasible solution found.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">
<p><b>Case 1:</b></p>
<p>Now, consider the first case where a feasible solution is found
for the program.</p>
<p>If this happens, then being feasible, the solution could always
be restricted by some number of entering or leaving variables. In
that case the line 11 of the procedure would never be executed.</p>
<p><b>Case 2</b>:</p>
<p>Now consider the other case:</p>
<p>If no feasible solution for the program could be found, there
would be no slack form for the program because there is no
solution. If that happens, it makes no sense to talk about the
bounded or unbounded form of the solution. Now keeping this in
mind, line 11 of the procedure would not be executed, either.</p>
<p>So, even in this the procedure would not return “unbounded”.</p>
<p>Thus, it can be recapitulated from the above discussion that if
the “while” loop is run by INITIALIZE-SIMPLEX, there “unbounded”
would never be returned regardless of the presence of any feasible
solution to the problem.</p>

<p>In simple words, the objective function of the primal form of

objective function of the linear program’s dual form.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">
<p>Now, the proof would be completed with corollary 29.9 (Refer to
the section 29.4 of the textbook for this).</p>
<p>Consider that the above rule holds for the set of primal and
dual form of a linear program that are <i>L</i> and <i>L’</i>
respectively. Along with this, the objective functions for both of
the primal and the dual form of the linear program equivalent then

<p>As the initial statement states that the fundamental solutions

values to zero yields:</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/3bb51a812829167ef3254f990c1f0e979a30d496.png"></p>
<p>That means, the value of the objective function of the dual from
of the linear program holds a value 0.</p>
<p>Now, as the strong duality rule says that if both of the primal
and the dual form of the linear program have the feasible and
optimal solutions, then the value of objective function of both of
them will be equivalent.</p>
<p>So, if the value of the objective function for the dual form is
0, then it will be 0 for the objective function of primal form.</p>

<p>In this case, procedure SIMPLEX is able to find a feasible
solution. Even in that case it might be possible that the solution
cannot be bounded by the means of any entering and leaving
variable.</p>
<p>If this happens the solution would remain unbounded. In that
case the procedure SIMPLEX returns “unbounded” and terminate the
program. There would be no slack form of the program achieved in
this case.</p>
<p><i><b>L</b></i> <b>is infeasible:</b></p>
Consider the case that there is no feasible solution for the
provided problem. If this happens then the linear program is not
feasible. The Procedure tries to find any feasible solution by
applying pivoting but the solution would not be found. Now SIMPLEX
procedure would not be able to find any feasible solution. Then the
SIMPLEX would simple return “infeasible” and terminate the program.
This is not possible to find any slack form in that case
also.</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer"><i><b>L</b></i> <b>has an optimal solution
which has finite objective value:</b> The third and the last case
is that there is an optimal solution for the program. In that case,
procedure finds an optimal solution for the program. If this
happens then the objective function would have a finite value. The
function would simply find the slack form of the linear program.
The procedure returns this slack form and the program is
terminated. Altogether it can be said that the fundamental theorem
of linear programming ensures that it can be determined if the
linear program has a feasible solution, a bounded solution or the
program is infeasible.</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">
<p><b>Strict inequalities:</b></p>
<p>A deep observance of the linear programming infers that the
theory holds for only the non-strict inequalities. That means there
exist, rules of the form:</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/b364d860965c4bf435be3740586fd7599b2ed614.png"></p>
<p>Or</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/1e477d37f5668b50b5a88fca0797413561acb309.png"></p>
<p>That means the right hand side of the expression might either be
equal to, greater than or less than the left hand side.</p>
<p>Strict inequality means that the right hand side of the equation
would either be greater than or smaller than the left hand side of
the expression.</p>
<p>Term strict inequalities means that it will have the form
as,</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/a3989cd9a36a7a0e826c7ab1fa552f5126b2d4ef.png"></p>
<p>Or</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/ee7cb74b91a38e18c67d8d09cb2b48bfd94b3e32.png"></p>
<p>This states that the value of d is strictly greater than or less
than the value of term<img src=
"../imgs/66755666b68546b49548f2b3339bf50c200d5586.png">. In a
single term, it can be stated as:</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/8deb4c1ed18ee45a00294ddb245ee1fdd08bc481.png"></p>
That is, the difference of the terms can never be equal to 0.</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">
<p><b>Effect of strict inequality on the linear program:</b></p>
<p>In no scenario, strict inequality can be allowed for the linear
programming. The reason is that if this is allowed for the linear
programming, it is not possible to determine any limit for the
value of term. That is, the value of term cannot be bounded between
two limits. This makes the linear programming lose its basic
objective which is to maximize the utilization of resources to any
extreme limit.</p>
<p>Consider the following example,</p>
<p>Suppose there is a concrete instance of the linear programming
as below:</p>
<p>Maximize</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/539d6e33dadd2713a308ac541bb1566b8486435d.png"></p>
<p>Subject to condition</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/2e2fd10670a2cc8422ca8eef92b8127140d591ae.png"></p>
<p>The program suggests maximizing the value of <i>y</i> to a limit
that is greater than 5.</p>
<p>In this case, it is not known what limit the value <i>y</i> is
to be maximized to. That means there might any number of values
that the value of <i>y</i> could be maximized to. It creates a
confusion that makes the linear programming not hold any
longer.</p>
<p>Now, it can be concluded that there will not be any value of
<i>y</i> for which the maximum will be obtained and so there will
not be any feasible solution for this consideration.</p>
<p>So, the above discussion explains that the linear programming
cannot be done with strict inequality allowed.</p>

<p><b>Variation of Dual and Primal</b></p>
<p>Linear programming is used to find out the best outcome from a
given number of equations. In linear programming, a list of
requirements is considered.</p>
<p>For better understanding of the question, a shallow look at
primal and dual of the linear programming would be required. In the
linear program, every primal has its corresponding dual.</p>
<p>It is shown below,</p>

<p>Here in the problem, a 1-variable linear program is given in
which there is a primal <i>P</i>. It also has a dual <i>D</i>.</p>
<p><b>Primal:</b></p>
<p>Consider the primal <i>P</i> given below:</p>

<p>Now, there are three kinds of the solution that can be found for
the concerned linear programs. They are discussed as below:</p>
<p><b>Optimal solution:</b> Optimal solution is a solution which
provides the best suited solution for the equations. When there is
more than 1 solution of linear programming, then the best solution
as per requirement is the optimal solution.</p>
<p><b>Feasible solution:</b> In linear programming, a feasible
solution is a solution which provides a single or infinite number
of solutions. In this case, many of the conditions are satisfied
which provides optimal solution.</p>
<p><b>Infeasible solution:</b> In linear programming, an infeasible
solution is a solution which does not have any solution. In this
case, the equations provide a parallel line.</p>
<p>There are certain implications of the feasibility of the primal
and the dual form of the linear program.</p>
<p>1. If there exists a feasible solution for the primal form of
the program and that is <img src=
"../imgs/8f8469678d35100f0af3bcd63c133bae0d4968f0.png">and for the
dual form that is<img src=
"../imgs/07c136328e5d7141536dbc5f9ace6acd1a508814.png">. Then</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/e311f50545cb1ee56ef9e9e5f0af1ef0caf0ff5c.png"></p>
<p>2. If there exists a feasible solution for the primal form of
the program, that is <img src=
"../imgs/8f8469678d35100f0af3bcd63c133bae0d4968f0.png"> but not for
the dual form of the program. Then</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/4d9c8629387a250afa43e1c5270f717c13ed1520.png"></p>
<p>That means</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/75f6f35c564c8c7468c4ddabaab0e30e6ae3e2df.png"></p>
<p>3. If there exists a feasible solution for the dual form of the
program, that is <img src=
"../imgs/07c136328e5d7141536dbc5f9ace6acd1a508814.png"> but not for
the dual form of the program. Then</p>
<p><img src=

<p>That means</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/62663702f93a8e04f5d332ac68cc209f92cddbfc.png"></p>
<p>4. There are no feasible solutions to either of the primal or
the dual form of the linear form.</p>
<p>Now, the condition is to be asserted on primal and dual for
various values of <i>r</i>, <i>s</i> and <i>t</i>.</p>
<p><b>1.</b> Both primal and the dual have optimal solutions with
the finite objective values. For this to happen both primal and
dual have feasible solution. Moreover, keeping the previously
discussed implications in mind the value of objective function of
the primal form would be equal to the objective function of the
dual form of the linear program.</p>
<p>To find the feasible solution for both of the primal and the
dual form, any of these values can be used,</p>
<p><b>a</b>.<img src=
"../imgs/4529777067c91b1663b405a95921253e698994d4.png">and<img src=

<p><b>b</b>. <img src=

has an arbitrary value.</p>
<p>In case <b>a</b>, the value of <i>r</i> is taken as less than 0,
value of <i>s</i> is equal to or greater than 0 and value of
<i>t</i> is either equal to or greater than 0. This condition
provides the optimal solution and SIMPLEX returns “feasible”.</p>
<p>In case <b>b</b>, the value of <i>r</i> is made equal to 0,
value of <i>s</i> can be either greater than or equal to zero and
the value of <i>t</i> remains same as that in case <b>a</b>. In
this, the SIMPLEX returns “feasible”.</p>
<p>In case <b>c</b>, the value of <i>r</i> is made greater than 0,
the value of <i>s</i> remains same as in case <b>b</b> and value of
<i>t</i> can take any of the arbitrary values. The value returned
by SIMPLEX is “feasible”.</p>

<div class="answer">
<p><b>2.</b> Primal <i>P</i> is feasible, but dual <i>D</i> is
infeasible.</p>
<p>In this case the value of the objective function of the primal
function would tend to negativity.</p>
<p>It is possible in two ways as,</p>
<p><b>a</b>. <img src=
"../imgs/17ee20dcfd60aa59770cd5172c1a68581058e42b.png">and<img src=
"../imgs/71a89118c6b80b0f49584f6c95ddde30b54c0869.png">.</p>
<p><b>b.</b> <img src=
"../imgs/b7e192d91f5feace59c1fe5862fc9e64179f117d.png">and<img src=
"../imgs/71a89118c6b80b0f49584f6c95ddde30b54c0869.png">.</p>
<p>In both ways, <b>a</b> and <b>b</b><i>,</i> the value of
<i>r</i> is taken either 0 or greater than 0 or less than 0. The
value of <i>s</i> is less than or equal to zero and the value of
<i>t</i> is taken greater than 0. These cases make the program
<i>P</i> as feasible and it is dual <i>D</i> as infeasible.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> Dual <i>D</i> is feasible but primal <i>P</i> is
infeasible.</p>
<p>In this case the value of the objective function of the dual
form must tend to infinity.</p>
<p>This condition is possible only when</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/d4e91d895f0d44071ddcb07ffb92397746cba7c1.png">, and</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/ced9a1aeab126c1dff7f27c4c4e2bb2b60d89ef6.png"></p>
<p>In the condition given above, the value of <i>r</i> is taken as
either equal to or greater than 0 and the value of is taken as less
than 0. This condition will provide infeasible solution for
<i>P</i> and feasible solution for its dual <i>D</i>.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> Neither primal <i>P</i> nor the dual <i>D</i> is
feasible. It is possible when <img src=
"../imgs/f07fe829aa0625666bcf75ac1ddf666810e31424.png">
and<img src="../imgs/71a89118c6b80b0f49584f6c95ddde30b54c0869.png">.</p>
<p>When the value of <i>r</i> is made equal to zero, the
substitution of the value in the respective objective function and
the constraints would yield the values of <i>s</i> and
<i>t</i>.</p>
<p>Now the value of <i>s</i> is less than 0 and value of <i>t</i>
as greater than 0.</p>
<p>This leads to providing infeasible solution for program <i>P</i>
and its dual <i>D</i>.</p>
