<p><b>Multithreaded Algorithms</b></p>
<p>Serial algorithms are used when multithread algorithms concept
was not evolved. The serial algorithms execute on the uniprocessor
system in which only one instruction is executed at a time. In
order to reduce the execution time of algorithm, a multithreaded
algorithm was evolved. A multithread algorithm executes on the
multiprocessor system in which more than one instruction can
execute at a time.</p>

<p><b>The effect of spawn on the asymptotic work, span and
parallelism</b></p>
<p><b>Spawn</b> is a subroutine that executes or runs at the same
time as that of parent. So by spawning, both parent and child work
simultaneously. The main motive behind evolving the concept of
spawning is to achieve parallelism, which results in increment in
the overall performance of the computer.</p>
<p><b>Work</b> is defined as the total time required for completing
the entire multithreaded computation on a single processor. Suppose
in the below example, each circle represents the strands which
takes unit time. Therefore, total work done is 25 units.</p>

<p><b>Span</b> is defined as the maximum time required for
completing the strands along any path in the directed acyclic graph
(DAG). It is an expensive path which contains maximum number of
strands. The path highlighted in the above figure is known as
span.</p>
<p>Work is the running time of a computation on a single processor.
Consider it as<img src=
"../imgs/cd65a02da6abeafabe4c9aceb8ede8419250ab7c.png">.</p>
<p>Now suppose there are unlimited numbers of processors. Then the

<div class="answer">
<p>Consider the algorithm P-FIB from the textbook:</p>
<p>If spawn is applied at the 4<sup>th</sup> line <img src=
"../imgs/a232cdb8a11f086fbff35b03ec1d8ac864a64c32.png">of P-FIB
algorithm rather than just calling the function without spawn then
there will be <b>no effect</b> on work, span or parallelism; this
is so, because this will not cause any change in its
serialization.</p>
<p>Consider the older version of P-FIB(<i>n</i>) algorithm as:</p>
<p>P-FIB(<i>n</i>)</p>
<p>1 <b>if</b><img src=
"../imgs/8640870eefa11e10fccb2eb1edaedd00d6278128.png"></p>

<p>6 <b>return</b><img src=

<p>Now in modified version of P-FIB(<i>n</i>-2) algorithm, there is
a change in only 4<sup>th</sup> line which is as below:</p>
<p>3 <b>else</b> <i>x</i>= <b>spawn</b> P-F<sub>IB</sub> (<img src=

"../imgs/62336ab039e6c87e717441ea201e2268758ff8ea.png">)</p>
<p>Spawn keyword is used to make operation in nested parallelism
format. Due to this, process does not wait to finish its child
process; and all process runs are in a parallel manner. One of the
major problems with spawn is that it cannot use return values
efficiently. Therefore in order to overcome this problem,
<b>sync</b> is used. It suspends the procedure till their all
children are not completed. That is why, applying spawn on
4<sup>th</sup> line of code will not affect work and span.</p>

<div class="answer">
<p><b>Analyzing the above modified algorithm:</b></p>
<p>Here three methods which are work, span and parallelism are used
for analyzing the algorithm which is as follow:</p>
<p><b>Work:</b></p>
<p>Workof the above modified P-FIB (<i>n</i>) algorithm will be
same as that of the execution time of its serialization in original
P-FIB (<i>n</i>) algorithm.</p>
<p>The number of calling of recursive function remains same in
P-F<sub>IB</sub> algorithm as in FIB algorithm. Hence, calculate
the work for P-F<sub>IB</sub> algorithm similar to F<sub>IB</sub>
algorithm.</p>
<p>Therefore, (from the equation 27.1 in the book)</p>
<p><img src=

<p><b>Multithreaded Algorithms</b></p>

had not been evolved. The serial algorithms executes on the
uniprocessor system in which only one instruction is execute at a

multithreaded algorithm has been evolved. A multithread algorithm
execute on the multiprocessor system in which more than one
instruction executes at a time.</p>

<p>In multithreaded algorithm of matrix multiplication, basic
concept of matrix multiplication is used. For making it into a
multithreaded form, just use the keywords parallel, spawn and
sync;</p>
<p><b>Parallel</b> is used in <b>for</b> loops to make them work in
a parallel manner;</p>
<p><b>Spawn</b> is used to solve the expression in a synchronized
manner; and starting point of the synchronization.</p>
<p><b>Sync</b> makes the output more systematic in nature.</p>
<p>In the following algorithm, the first-half recursively calls a
new function, in which, the code recursively spawns the first half
of the iteration of the loop, to execute in parallel with the
second half of the iteration; and then it executes in sync.</p>

work simultaneously. The main motive behind for evolving the
concept of spawning is to achieve parallelism, which results in
increase the overall performance of computer.</p>
<p><b>Work</b> is defined as total time required for completing the
entire multithreaded computation on a single processor. Suppose in
the below example, each circle represents the strands which takes
unit time. Therefore, total work done is 25 units.</p>

<p><b>Normal 'for' loop:</b></p>
<p>When there is a small task that consists of subtasks which are

used.</p>
<p>It executes on a single processor sequentially and the order of
result is defined as sequential in this loop.</p>
<p>For example:</p>

<p>Parallel 'for' loop is used for Parallelism, which is taking a

needs fast execution. This is possible when this process can be

on a single processor.</p>
