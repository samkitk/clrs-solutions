<p>Independent set of a graph <i>G</i> represents the set or
collection of vertices that are not adjacent to one another. It is
a concept in graph theory according to which there should not be
any edge connecting the two vertices of a set.</p>
<p>• It is also known as a <b>stable set</b> in which an edge can
have at most single endpoint in the graph.</p>
<p>• Thus, the vertices contained in the independent set represent
the subset of the vertices of a graph.</p>

<p>Given that the degree of the graph <i>G</i> is 2, which implies

in order to solve the problem of an independent set we must have
the graph as a simple cycle.</p>
<p>Consider the graphs given below of degree 2 and thus, containing
a simple cycle.</p>

<p>Here, it is required to give an algorithm to solve the

<p>• A <b>bipartite graph</b> commonly known as the bigraph is an
undirected graph whose vertex set can be partitioned or arranged
into two disjoint sets that are independent.</p>
<p>• It is possible to color this type of graph by using the two
colors only so it is 2 colorable or bi-chromatic.</p>
<p>• There are several applications of these graphs like in case of
matching problems.</p>
<p><b>For example:</b></p>
<p>Consider a bipartite graph given below containing two set of
vertices <i>V</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>V</i><sub>2</sub>, such that
<img src="../imgs/e2ec5e6a46a267151c1827cf2201558426a7d689.png">and

the two independent set of vertices that are not adjacent to one

<p>In a bipartite graph the matching is a group of edges such that
any of its edges do not share the same end points. A vertex,

creation of a matched edge is called as the saturated vertex.</p>

<p>Consider the graph below which highlights the edges of matched

<p><img src=
"../imgs/9ff3900679f8675d6e244753b9ac6c51e8cb796d.png"></p>
<p>Matching is also called as maximal matching if there is no more
edges that can be included into the matching set <i>M</i> and it’s
called the ideal or the perfect matching if no unmatched vertex is
found.</p>

<p><b>In a bipartite graph, to determine independent set, following

<p>Consider the following graph <i>G</i> for coloring by using two
colors and apply the procedure to color the vertices of the graph
is as follows:</p>
<p>1. First take any vertex of the graph as the starting vertex and
paint it by using one of the two colors given to color the
graph.</p>
<p>2. Find all the vertices that are connected to the first vertex
with neighboring edges and color all of them from the second
color.</p>
<p>3. Apply breadth first search to find the edges that are not
visited yet and if there is any edge in the graph whose both
vertices are painted with same color.</p>
<p>4. <b>if</b> there exist such edges whose both end vertices are
painted in same color</p>
<p>5. graph will not be 2-colorable;</p>
<p>6. <b>else</b></p>
<p>7. it will be 2-colorable.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">
<p><b>b.</b></p>
<p>Consider the following procedure to show that decision problem
is solvable in polynomial time.</p>
<p>Consider an undirected graph <i>G</i> (<i>V,E</i>) with <i>V</i>
vertices and <i>E</i> edges, coloring this graph by using <i>k</i>
different colors such that all neighboring vertices are colored
with different colors.</p>
<p>• If the graph coloring problem is in polynomial time then
checking, if the value of <i>k</i> is greater than the least number
of colors required to color the graph.</p>
<p>• If <i>k</i> is greater than the decision problem then it will
be false and it will not be <i>k</i>-colorable. Else it will be
true that is the graph will be <i>k</i>-colorable.</p>
<p><b>c.</b></p>
<p>In the graph coloring firstly a colored graph is check if any
edge in the graph whose both end vertices are painted with the same
color. This verification process of color can be completed in
polynomial time.</p>
<p>• The 3-COLOR problem can be reformed as the decision problem
which is a polynomial time problem.</p>
<p>• For the conversion of the 3-COLOR problem to a decision
problem consider graph <i>G</i>= (<i>V</i>, <i>E</i>) with <i>V</i>
vertices and <i>E</i> undirected edges, new <img src=
"../imgs/056a154328f42282c2745793aba49415bfd230e5.png">connected
vertices are added to the graph.</p>
<p>• All other vertices are connected to these vertices with edges
and this creates a new graph <i>G’.</i></p>
<p>• Now the graph <i>G</i> will be 3-colorable only when the graph
<i>G</i>’ will be painted by using <i>k</i> colors. This conversion
of the 3-COLOR problem is polynomial time.</p>
<p><b>Hence, if 3-COLOR is an NPC, the</b> <i><b>k</b></i>
<b>-colorable problem will surely be NPC because it is
convertible.</b></p>

<p>Consider the variable <i>x</i> in its generalized form the

neighbors of each other and both of these are attached to the RED
vertex. The same thing happens to TRUE and FALSE that is for any
edge one of its variable is TRUE and the other is FALSE.</p>
<p>So, in any 3-coloring<img src=

<p><b>Hence it proves the statement that in 3-coloring graph with
literal edges both the variables of its are colored differently
that is TRUE and FALSE.</b></p>
<p>User can color the graph containing only literal edges by using
the procedure which is as follows:</p>
<p>• Color the node named RED using one color, give the variable
and TRUE the same color, and variable negation and FALSE the same
color.</p>
<p>• When the nodes of the graph are fully painted then we will see
that no literal edge is connected with the vertices painted with

<p>A problem that is of NP-Complete then it must be of polynomial

<p>As discussed in the part <i>c</i> of this problem the 3-COLOR
problem is polynomial verifiable. To prove that 3-COLOR is in
NP-Hard we reduce 3-CNF-SAT to 3-COLOR because it is polynomial
reducible.</p>
<p>For a 3-CNF-SAT problem, user creates the graph containing only
the literal edges and creates one widget for each clause.</p>
<p>Now user shows that 3-CNF-SAT has a solution, only if the graph
is 3-COLORABLE which is as:</p>
<p>1. If the 3-CNF-SAT has got a truth assignment, then for each
widget, at least one of <i>x, y</i> and <i>z</i> is painted
<i>TRUE</i>.</p>
<p>As discussed in part <i>e</i>, every widget is 3-COLORABLE and
the graph containing only the literal edges is always 3-COLORABLE
as discussed in part <i>d</i> of this problem. Thus we can derive
the conclusion that the graph is 3-COLORABLE.</p>
<p>2. If the graph is 3-COLORABLE, then in every widget, one of
<i>x, y</i> and <i>z</i> has to be</p>
<p><i>TRUE</i>. Just give the truth assignment as<img src=

that 3-CNF-SAT is satisfiable.</p>
<p>Thus the 3-COLOR problem is in NP-Hard.</p>
<p><b>Hence the 3-COLOR problem is polynomial time verifiable and

<p>The objective is to give a polynomial time algorithm for the
optimization problem using dynamic programming approach and by
assuming that all processing times are integers from 1 to
<i>n</i>.</p>
<p>Optimization problem aims at finding the best possible solution
to a problem from a set or a list of all possible solutions. These
are the type of problems that can have several numbers of feasible
solutions. Optimization problem provides a maximum or minimum value
for a problem in an optimized way. Using dynamic programming
optimization problem can be solved by characterizing the structure
of an optimal solution first</p>
<p>For the optimization problem the same dynamic programming
algorithm as described in part <b>(c)</b> can be used with the
change in the recurrence as,</p>
