<p><b>Red Black Tree:</b></p>
<p>A binary search tree can be called as a red black tree when it
satisfies following properties:</p>
<p>1. Each node of tree must be either red or black in color.</p>
<p>2. The root of tree must be black.</p>
<p>3. The color of every leaf must be black.</p>
<p>4. When parent node color is red, then color of its both
children must be black.</p>
<p>5. The number of black node from any node to leave must be
same.</p>
<p>Consider the Algorithm RB-INSERT() to insert a new node in
Red-Black tree. Whenever a new node is inserted into a Red-Black
tree, in line 16 of RB-INSERT(), the color of the new node is set
to red so that the inserting a new node does not make any effect on
black-height of Red-Black tree. That is , the property 4 is not
violated.</p>
<p>If the newly inserted node z’s color is set to black, it may
violate the 5<sup>th</sup> red-black property. That is, the black
height of the tree is affected.</p>
<p><b>Hence, the color of the newly inserted node is always chosen
to set to red in line 16 of RB-INSERT.</b></p>

<p><b>RB-INSERT-FIXUP algorithm</b></p>
<p>Professor Teach said that in the algorithm of RB-INSERT-FIXUP if
the color of terminal node which is the child of node <i>z</i> is
set to red then the loop in first line of algorithm will not
terminate. And insertion of a node <i>z</i> in the RB-Tree is
inserted as the root of the tree.</p>
<p>Refer the page number 316 from textbook for RB-INSERT-FIXUP
algorithm.</p>
<p>With the help of argument that in RB-INSERT-FIXUP
algorithm<img src=
"../imgs/04bd245f5fe2f96fb37f27452a79e6f592c30e41.png">is never set
to red, proving that professor’s concern is baseless.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">
<p>Red Black Tree is a special type of tree in which each node
contains an extra bit for the storage of the color of that node. So
each node of Red Black Tree contains five fields <i>p</i> for
parent, <i>left</i> for left child, <i>right</i> for right child,
<i>key</i> for data value and <i>color</i> for color of the
node.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">In RB-INSERT-FIXUP, fix the properties of the
RB-Tree that are violated because of inserting a new element and
painting it red.</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">This algorithm first check if the parent of the
inserted node is red and if it is then the property of RB-Tree is
violated because a red node will not have the red child. In this
case this algorithm fixes the properties of the RB-Tree.</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">
<p>In the RB-INSERT-FIXUP algorithm the colors are set red only in
two cases, in case 1 and case 3, the parent of the parent of
<i>z</i> that is<img src=
"../imgs/24542da519ef664ba6f0dea1f3b0564a7470add8.png">colored
red.</p>
<p>1. If<img src=
"../imgs/99f93378d2da5ffcf11d041d7b863da67ec124be.png"> is the
sentinel, then <img src=
"../imgs/43cad17aa5fe3e0c975cfa68695aed4f5a656258.png">is the root
and if<img src=
"../imgs/43cad17aa5fe3e0c975cfa68695aed4f5a656258.png">is root then
its color will be black and the loop in line 1 of algorithm will
terminate.</p>
<p>2. The only subtlety is in case 2, where,</p>
<p>3. Set<img src=

<p>Hence professor’s consideration that “in the algorithm of

<p>Consider the following three possible cases of inserting a node
into a Red-Black tree using RB-INSERT:</p>
<p>1. An Empty Red-Black tree (does not have any node).</p>
<p>2. Red-black tree with only black nodes (<img src=
"../imgs/6078330f3814634d95b1996211d9461e02665cee.png">, where
<i>n</i> is the number of nodes)</p>
<p>3. Red-black tree with some black and red nodes.</p>
<p>• <b>Consider inserting a node into an empty red-black
tree:</b></p>
<p>If a node is inserted into empty red-black tree using RB-INSERT,
then the inserted node becomes the root and since the tree contains
only one black node. But it does not satisfy the condition<img src=
"../imgs/6078330f3814634d95b1996211d9461e02665cee.png">, where
<i>n</i> is the number of nodes.</p>
<p>Now, if another node is inserted into the tree, then the
RB-INSERT assigns red-color to the second node to balance the
black-height. Therefore, if n=2, the red-black tree contains at
least one red node.</p>
<p>• <b>Consider inserting a node into a red-black tree with all
black-nodes:</b></p>
<p>If a new node is inserted into a red-black node with all black
nodes using the RB-INSERT function, the new node is assigned red
color and The last line of RB-INSERT function calls the
RB-INSERT-FIXUP().</p>
<p>The first line of RB-INSERT-FIXUP() checks whether the parent of
newly inserted node is red or not. Since the given tree has only
black nodes, newly inserted node remains red in color.</p>
<p>Therefore, in this case also the tree contains at least one red
node.</p>
<p>• <b>Consider inserting a node into a red-black tree with some
black and red nodes:</b></p>
<p>Since, the red-black tree have both red and black node, it is
already satisfying the condition that if <img src=
"../imgs/6078330f3814634d95b1996211d9461e02665cee.png"> then
at-least one node is red. Even though a new node is inserted into
this tree and RB-INSERT-FIXUP makes changes, the tree contains at
least one red node.</p>
<p><b>Hence, it is true that a Red-Black tree has at-least one red
node when number of nodes in the red-black tree is greater than
1.</b></p>
