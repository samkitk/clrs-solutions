<p>At every stack operation, the charge is twice. First the actual
cost of the operation which is performed on the stack is charged
and second the cost of copying an element later is charged.</p>
<p>The maximum size of the stack can never exceed k, so there will
be k operations. And after every k operations, at least k units
will be left.</p>

<p>• The accounting analysis is done by assuming amortized costs
for a given operation.</p>
<p>• In the accounting method, the operations are charged with
different costs than its actual cost.</p>
<p>• This cost can be less or more than the actual cost an
operation.</p>
<p>• The amount charges for an operation is called as <b>amortized
cost.</b></p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">
<p><b>For the operation i, the actual cost is as follows:</b></p>
<p><img src=

<p><b>Assume the amortized cost to be as follows:</b></p>

<p>• For an operation, which is expressed as an exact power of 2,
its actual cost will be the sum of the credit which is accumulated
and the amortized cost of its own which is one unit.</p>
<p>The credits which are left will be assigned as credit.</p>
<p>• And, if the operation is not the exact power of two, then that
operation will use its one unit to pay its actual cost and the cost
left which is 2 will be assigned as credit.</p>
<p><b>If the operation can be expressed in the terms of power of 2
then, the value of c</b> <sub>i</sub> <b>is as follows:</b></p>

<p><img src=

<p><b>And the value of the</b> <b><img src=

as follows:</b></p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/a995572b2d06b8705d98ca5f093dcf2d13a3682e.png"></p>
<p>Since, the value of (2<sup>n</sup> – 3n) is always greater than
1 for n = 0 and all n &gt; 1 therefore, the value of <img src=
"../imgs/a82324cd05476c0da2b665beb8aae564c3c0ff4f.png">will always
be greater than ci for n=0 and n&gt;1.</p>
<p>Now for n=1, the value of <img src=
"../imgs/a82324cd05476c0da2b665beb8aae564c3c0ff4f.png"> is 2 and
the value of ci is 1.</p>
<p>Thus, the value of c<sub>i</sub> is always less than <img src=
"../imgs/a82324cd05476c0da2b665beb8aae564c3c0ff4f.png">.</p>
<p>Therefore, as per the accounting analysis, the amortized cost is
always greater than the actual cost which can be represented as
follows:</p>

<p>Consider a variable <i>A.max</i> to hold the higher-order of 1
in <i>A</i>. <i>A.max</i> helps to use the amount limit to the
credit resulted by INCREMENTs. That is, using <i>A.max</i> ensures
RESET to use not more than the amount available in credit.
Initially, <i>A.max</i> is assigned with -1, because initially,
there are no 1’s in the counter. <i>A.max</i> is updated when the
counter is incremented and reset.</p>

<p>When a bit is set to 1, $2 will be paid. One dollar is for
setting a bit to 1 and another for resetting a bit to 0. That is,
$1 is credited for each insertion. Thus, credit has dollars equal
to number of 1s in the counter.</p>
<p>• It is known that $1 is required to reset a bit to 0. RESET
makes all 1s in the counter to 0.This uses the dollars in credit
that is the result of earlier INCREMENTs. Thus, for resetting all
1s to 0s, there is no need of paying dollars.</p>
<p>• In addition to $2 (for increment and reset), $1 is paid to
update max. Thus, INCREMENT pays $3 each time ($2 for setting a bit
to 1 and $1 for updating <i>A.max</i> with higher-order of 1).</p>
<p>• RESET pays $1 for updating <i>A.max</i> as -1. Since RESET
runs loop to reset bits upto <i>A.max</i> and since every 1 bit
seen by RESET has $1 of credit on it, the zeroing of bits of
<i>A</i> can be completely paid for, by the credit stored on the
bits.</p>
<p>• Only $1 more is to paid for resetting max.</p>
<p>Since the INCREMENT and RESET are charging a constant amount $4,
the sequence of <i>n</i> INCREMENT and RESET operations takes
O(<i>n</i>) time.</p>
