<p>An <i>array</i> is a variable that holds multiple values of the
same data type.</p>
<p><b>Strengths of array:</b></p>
<p>1. Multiple data items of same type can be referred by using a
single name.</p>
<p>2. The elements of an array can be accessed directly by
index.</p>
<p>3. Arrays can be used to implement other data structures like
linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs etc.</p>
<p>4. Iterating through an array has a good locality of
reference.</p>
<p>5. Arrays can be used to represent multi-dimensional data like
matrices and tables.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">
<p><b>Limitations of array:</b></p>
<p>1. Array is a static data structure. Memory is allocated at
compile time and cannot be changed during run time.</p>
<p>2. It is difficult to insert elements into an array or delete
elements from an array.</p>
<p>3. Memory is wasted in the case when a large size array is
declared and uses only few locations.</p>
<p>4. Array cannot grow or shrink dynamically.</p>

<p><b>The Shortest path problem:</b></p>
<p>The shortest path problem in graph theory is the problem to find
a path between two nodes (or vertices) in the given graph such that
the sum of its constituent’s edges weights is minimized.</p>
<p><b>The travelling-salesman problem (TSP):</b></p>
<p>The TSP (Travelling Salesman problem) is defined as an NP-hard
problem in combinatorial optimization studied in theoretical
computer science and operations research.</p>
<p>In TSP, the main task is to find a shortest possible path which
visits each nodes or vertices exactly once and return the starting
node.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">
<p>The travelling salesman and shortest path problem are similar in
the following manner:</p>
<p>• Both the travelling salesman and shortest path problem are
minimization problems.</p>
<p>• Both the problems will minimize the overall distance
travelled.</p>
<p>• The travelling salesman and shortest path problem traverses a
graph to find the path.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">
<p>The travelling salesman and shortest path problem are different
in the following manner:</p>
<p>• In shortest path problem, there just need to minimize the
distance between the two nodes or vertices. There is no matter of
routes that exist between them.</p>
<p>• But in the travelling salesman problem, it requires a path
between multiple points (or nodes) that returns to the first point
(or node).</p>

<p>There are many more real world problems where best solution is
required. An approximate solution is not acceptable in these cases
because it may cause a loss of life or too much money. Some of real
world problems are as follow:</p>
<p>• <b>Medical science:</b> The instrument uses in medical science
must provide the exact information. When the output of the machine
(like cardiograph machine) is not accurate then it may possible the
patient will not get the proper treatment.</p>
<p>• <b>Costly research:</b> Suppose researcher tries to found out
the trajectory of a satellite, then in that case they want the best
solution. It is because satellite launching is very expensive and
if anything goes wrong then the whole project get fall down.</p>
<p>There are also many situations where an approximate solution is
also acceptable. Here approximate solution does not lead to loss of
life or too much money.</p>
<p>• Suppose a person has to find a shortest path between two
cities. In that case best solution is not required because if he
does not succeed to find the shortest then still he reach the
destination.</p>
<p>• An approximate solution is also acceptable in weather
forecasting. A weather forecasting includes lots of approximation
and analyses of previous data.</p>
