<p><b>Maximum- Flow Min-Cut Problem</b></p>
<p>The dual of the linear program for the maximum flow as explained
in line 29.47 to 29.50, has to be written. Also, it is to be
presented as the minimum cut problem. For this, below is given a
brief idea of maximum flow and minimum cut in any flow network.</p>
<p>A flow network is nothing but a directed graph of vertices and
edges. Each of the graph edge has a capacity. The capacity defines
the data value that can go through that edge. The capacity is
always greater than 0. One more thing is that if there is an edge
going from a vertex <img src=
"../imgs/d652a1e29926c5cd1d68942672a5276417cdb8f4.png"> to
vertex<img src=
"../imgs/b466d402aed63504ee39c4d8623924feccbdfff8.png">, then no
edge can go from <img src=
"../imgs/b466d402aed63504ee39c4d8623924feccbdfff8.png"> to
<img src="../imgs/d652a1e29926c5cd1d68942672a5276417cdb8f4.png">.</p>
<p><img src="../imgs/f7c99af66cca771168fbcf08c94e0e92a3e3e366.png"
alt="Description: C:\Users\evelyn 16\Desktop\CDR TIP\11.tif"></p>
<p><b>Maximum Flow:</b></p>
<p>In the above diagram, vertex <i>s</i> is the origin and the
vertex <i>t</i> is the sink or destination. The capacity of each
edge is shown alongside the edge.</p>
<p>Now the possible flows paths from the source to destination can
be:</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/6658c581aa6d55349a52d007a819b0155f0bea7a.png"></p>
<p>There might be a few more flow paths as well. The maximum amount
of possible flow through a path is equal to the least capacity of
an edge.</p>
<p>For example in the first flow path<img src=
"../imgs/cc609fe111c760f876937144022e3d2c019a817f.png">, the
maximum flow would be 12.</p>
<p><b>Minimum Cut:</b></p>
<p>A cut in a network is the collection of network edges that, when
deleted or ignored from the network stop the flow of data from the
source to sink. Amongst the set of cuts the one that has the
minimum capacity is known as the minimum cut.</p>
<p><b>For example:</b></p>
<p>In the above graph, the possible cuts are:</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/99676ee9742853a07b381f4bf66da800525fc542.png"></p>
<p>These cuts are as shown below in the graph:</p>
<p><img src="../imgs/61474230ae0df8509e43b796c1da2a4289f403a5.png"
alt="Description: C:\Users\evelyn 16\Desktop\CDR TIP\12.tif"></p>
<p>Removal of any of the given set of edges would leave the network
disconnected and reaching destination from source would not be
possible either way.</p>
<p>In the possible cuts of the above network the cut<img src=
"../imgs/c712e4c5b825adac934a10342d7750330ecb10ea.png">has the
least capacity and that is <img src=
"../imgs/a649ce459b79a8dd9b495657ec771801edb173db.png">.
<i>v</i><sub>2</sub><i>v</i><sub>1</sub> is assigned a capacity 0
because that is in the reverse direction of <i>sv</i><sub>2</sub>
and <i>v</i><sub>1</sub><i>v</i><sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p>So, this is the minimum cut for the above mentioned network.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">
<p>Dual of a linear program is the mirror image of itself. If dual
is found for the program that is already a dual of some linear
program that yields the linear program. The original form of the
linear program is known as the primal form.</p>
<p>The dual for the linear program of the maximum flow problem
actually simulates the Maximum-Cut-Minimum-Flow theorem. In writing
the dual of a linear program, most convenient practice is to write
the original equation in a form that is more aesthetic than the
primal form.</p>
<p>This could be accomplished by reducing the number of constraints
so that the in creation of the dual program, few variables have to
be defined. Sometimes it might tend to the occurrence of many new
variables in the primal equation.</p>
<p>To make this happen this, the flow network can be thought of as
a collection of paths, through which the flow is travelling, rather
than a collection of edges. This would diminish the number of
constraints in the program. Now the conservation constraints can be
ignored in the program.</p>
<p>Now keeping the above discussion in mind, in the creation of
dual, a variable <img src=
"../imgs/89c8633de86bbd42e7c37359b762705c59594d40.png">is
considered for path from source of the network <i>s</i> to the
target of the network <i>t</i>. <i>P</i> is denoted as the set of
path, for specifying how much flow is along the path <i>p</i>.</p>
<p>Now the equations take the below form:</p>
<p>Maximize<img src=
"../imgs/901226ec413960c757f950e03cf506b03de5a191.png"> <b>… …
(1)</b></p>
<p>Subject to the condition</p>
<p><img src="../imgs/32daab722a835be76b291d1e25124593c64b87ee.png">
<b>… … (2)</b></p>
<p><img src="../imgs/6a58c7603b33523f41c7aa89066114dce8e65a58.png">
<b>… … (3)</b></p>
<p><b>Minimum-Cut Formulation:</b></p>
<p>Now as the linear program of the maximum flow has been expressed
into the simpler terms, it is evident that there was only one new
variable introduced in the modified form of the primal. So in the
dual form, only one new variable per edge of the network would be
used.</p>
<p>Consider the new variable in the dual form be<img src=
"../imgs/3ba71cd3e5c4a8bb3f7a83d2726f622d408a16fe.png">. For every
edge<img src=
"../imgs/bd1c53ec28d4a80cfbcdcdafac33e183abb8d47c.png"> of the
network, there is one<img src=
"../imgs/3ba71cd3e5c4a8bb3f7a83d2726f622d408a16fe.png">.</p>
<p>The linear program would now be as below:</p>
<p>Minimize</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/5859112c8f0131422e014f25fd740c69c6e9fd14.png"></p>
<p>Subject to condition</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/170a99c7d003ddb4d3fa0059a4c3091e8acb7455.png">; <img src=

<p><img src=

"../imgs/aa75e609836ce655bdb4b39b1ad73922cca0b26b.png"></p>
<p>Now, have a deeper understanding of the dual of the maximum flow
linear program. The variable <img src=
"../imgs/8c17b80620445b83f64ed3dbaba41d9560fb90bc.png">augments a
weight to each of the edge. This weight can be thought of as the
“length” from source to destination.</p>
<p>Now to find the minimum cut the flow has to be minimized. So,
the intention over here is to find the path that has the minimum
flow. For this the objective function is intended to find the
minimum path. The same is the yield of the Maximum-Flow-Minimum-Cut
theorem.</p>
<p>Now, the objective function is the subject to the constraints
that for every path that is constituted of the edges the minimum
value is one unit. That means the source and the target are always
separable or it can be said that they are always different nodes of
the network.</p>
<p>Another constraint is that the value of the variable for any
edge has to be either 0 or any positive integer. This ensures that
the capacity can never be negative and that is what the basic rule
for capacity of the flow network says.</p>
<p>This way, it can be concluded that the dual of the linear
program of the maximum flow of a network yield the linear program
that represents the minimum cut for the same flow network.</p>

<p><b>Minimum-Cost Flow Problem</b></p>
<p>Minimum cost flow problem is the way of finding the path with
least possible cost that leads a flow data from the origin to the
destination.</p>
<p>This problem has certain real life applications. Some analogies
to this are the telecommunication networks, goods transportation
system and many others.</p>
<p>This problem is just an extension in the maximum flow problem.
All the things that are in the maximum flow problem do exist in the
minimum-cost flow problem. In this there is a new real valued
function added. This new function is cost.</p>
<p>Cost is associated with every edge just like the capacity.
Another thing associated with the network is the flow demand; the
amount of flow that is to be moved. The cost is negotiated
according to the flow demand.</p>
<p>So, the objective in this is to minimize the cost defined by the
function</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/3061bdc76197393b8298ef269b73bbf7ee5e3d9b.png"></p>
<p>This should be achieved with conformation to the flow and the
capacity constraints for the flow network.</p>
<p><img src="../imgs/aa017b7d2b91c45e2c2425c8301b894f0a5dc4a5.png"
alt="C:\Users\evelyn 16\Desktop\CDR TIP\6.tif"></p>
<p>The diagram above shows an example of the problem. The capacity
and the cost of each of the edge are written alongside the edge.
For instance the capacity of the edge from vertex <i>s</i> to
vertex <i>x</i> is 5 and the cost of moving the flow is 2.</p>
<p>Now suppose that the demand is 4 units.</p>
<p>So, the objective is to find the path through the network that
these 4 units can be moved from <i>s</i> to <i>t</i>.</p>
<p><img src="../imgs/33d2bb009fd0fe97d78f3ceff1082b8958faf10f.png"
alt="C:\Users\evelyn 16\Desktop\CDR TIP\8.tif"></p>
<p>The diagram above shows a remedy to the problem. In this 2 units
of flow are being sent from <i>s</i> to <i>x</i> and 2 units are
from <i>s</i> to <i>y</i>. From <i>x</i> the flow is bifurcated; 1
unit goes to <i>t</i> directly and 1 unit is sent to <i>y</i>. This
is done because the cost of moving the flow through <img src=
"../imgs/e9957c7fc452cf5c3924795c79512ca62fed68e5.png">is more
efficient than moving it through<img src=
"../imgs/0d0232b5cd3849373f546641171f71b3ead93e1f.png">. But
because the capacity of <img src=
"../imgs/e9957c7fc452cf5c3924795c79512ca62fed68e5.png">restricts
the flow going through that, so after exhausting the flow limit of
<img src="../imgs/e9957c7fc452cf5c3924795c79512ca62fed68e5.png">
the remaining flow is sent through<img src=
"../imgs/0d0232b5cd3849373f546641171f71b3ead93e1f.png">.</p>
<p>Now the flow to be moved from <i>y</i> is 3 units. This is the
sum of the flow reaching from <img src=
"../imgs/e9957c7fc452cf5c3924795c79512ca62fed68e5.png">
and<img src="../imgs/1df2b773d47f8118f546f64fa5e486a56dff368b.png">.
The flow conservation obligates the 3 units to leave node
<i>y</i>.</p>
<p>So, 3 units are sent to <i>t</i> from <i>y</i>.</p>
The linear program representing this problem is formulated in
29.51-29.52 (refer to the section 29.2 of the textbook).</div>

<p><b>Dual of Minimum-Cost Flow Problem:</b></p>
<p>Dual of a linear program is the mirror image of itself. If dual
is found for the program that is already a dual of some linear

They are as below:</p>

conservation.</p>
<p>2. An upper limit constraint for each of the edges.</p>

<p><b>Interpretation in terms of flows and graph:</b></p>
<p>It is obvious that the min cost flow problem is deeply related
to the maximum flow problem. The only difference is the addition of
cost and demand in the network.</p>
<p>The objective in this problem is to find the flow with minimum
cost. The amount of flow that is to be migrated from source is
already negotiated in the problem.</p>
<p>This problem has a deep resemblance with the single source
shortest path problem. In that the objective is to find the least
possible cost of visiting all the nodes of the graph from a given
node.</p>
<p>All possible paths from a node to all other nodes, that are not
previously visited, would be checked. The paths with the least
possible cost would be considered and all other would be discarded
just like they do in single source shortest path problem.</p>
<p>However, the flow going out of any vertex, can be bifurcated to
achieve the optimum cost of moving the flow from that vertex to the
target. That can later be united at some eventual vertex on the
way. The reason behind this is that a flow through any edge cannot
exceed the capacity of that edge. Keeping this in mind the flow can
be forked so that the accomplishment of minimum cost and the flow
movement can be done together.</p>
<p>This problem can be thought of as the single source shortest
paths problem, in which the source of the network must be
considered the node that the paths are to be searched from.</p>
<p>Now as no anti-parallel edges are there so there would be nodes
included other than the source and the target and there would be
only one path possible between two nodes. The cost of visiting that
edge would be equal to the cost function of the same edge.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">
<p>So, the above discussion can be recapitulated to show the
minimum cost flow problem in terms of graphs and flows as
below:</p>
<p>Minimum cost problem is a set of shortest paths (least cost
path) from one node to another in the graph (flow network) that
constitute the cheapest path from origin node (single source) to
target node.</p>
<p>If this statement is put into the form of a mathematical
equation it yields the same formula that is used to get the minimum
cost flow in a network.</p>

<p><b>Weak Duality for Maximum-Flow Problem</b></p>
<p>Minimum cut is the thing that can be considered as the weak

<p>A flow network is nothing but a directed graph of vertices and

"../imgs/cc609fe111c760f876937144022e3d2c019a817f.png">, the
maximum flow would be 12.</p>
<p><b>Minimum Cut:</b></p>
<p>A cut in a network is the collection of network edges that, when
deleted or ignored from the network stop the flow of data from the
source to sink. Amongst the set of cuts the one that has the
minimum capacity is known as the minimum cut.</p>
<p><b>For example</b>:</p>
<p>In the above graph the possible cuts are:</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/99676ee9742853a07b381f4bf66da800525fc542.png"></p>
<p><img src="../imgs/61474230ae0df8509e43b796c1da2a4289f403a5.png"
alt="Description: C:\Users\evelyn 16\Desktop\CDR TIP\12.tif"></p>
<p>Removal of any of the given set of edges would leave the network
disconnected and reaching destination from source would not be
possible either way.</p>
<p>In the possible cuts of the above network, the cut<img src=
"../imgs/c712e4c5b825adac934a10342d7750330ecb10ea.png">has the
least capacity and that is<img src=
"../imgs/a649ce459b79a8dd9b495657ec771801edb173db.png">. <img src=
"../imgs/025b6fe3d8494d3e6e232deab09251614ac30bc7.png"> is assigned
a capacity 0 because that is in the reverse direction of <img src=
"../imgs/8e7c805af44cf3f1cb4be9e433d97f0d412a4b8c.png"> and
<img src=
"../imgs/2019c5aaa9008dde5edc06388dc7f5d267ec5482.png">.</p>
<p>So, this is the minimum cut for the above mentioned network.</p>

<div class="answer">
<p><b>Dual program:</b></p>
<p>Dual for any linear program is the mirror image of itself. If
dual is found for the program that itself is a dual of some linear
program that results in the original linear program. The initial
form of the linear program is known as the primal form.</p>
<p>The dual for the linear program of the maximum flow problem
actually simulates the Maximum-Cut-Minimum-Flow theorem.</p>
<p>In writing the dual of a linear program, most convenient
practice is to write the original equation in a form that is more
aesthetic as compared to the primal form.</p>
<p>This is accomplished by reducing the number of constraints. This
ends up in the creation of few new variables. Sometimes it might
tend to the occurrence of many new variables in the primal
equation.</p>
<p>To make this happen this, the flow network can be thought of as
a collection of paths, through which the flow is travelling, rather
than a collection of edges. This would diminish constraints in
theprogram. Now the conservation constraints can be ignored in the
program.</p>
<p>Now keeping the above discussion in mind, in the creation of
dual, a variable <img src=
"../imgs/89c8633de86bbd42e7c37359b762705c59594d40.png">is
considered for path from source of the network <i>s</i> to the
target of the network <i>t</i>. <i>P</i> is denoted as the set of
path, for specifying how much flow is along the path <i>p</i>.</p>
<p>Now, the equations take the below form:</p>
<p>Maximize</p>
<p><img src="../imgs/901226ec413960c757f950e03cf506b03de5a191.png">
<b>… … (1)</b></p>
<p>Subject to the condition</p>
<p><img src="../imgs/049a687774c946b3e51fae072589b68e175d7870.png">
<b>… … (2)</b></p>
<p><img src="../imgs/ca099dd44c083bc4b2b430240e218338dc743694.png">
<b>… … (3)</b></p>
<p><b>Minimum-Cut Formulation:</b></p>
<p>Now as the linear program of the maximum flow has been expressed
into the simpler terms, it is evident that there was only one new
variable introduced in the modified form of the primal.</p>
<p>So in the dual form, only one new variable per edge of the
network would be used.</p>
<p>Consider the new variable in the dual form be<img src=
"../imgs/3ba71cd3e5c4a8bb3f7a83d2726f622d408a16fe.png">. For every
edge<img src=
"../imgs/bd1c53ec28d4a80cfbcdcdafac33e183abb8d47c.png"> of the
network, there is one<img src=
"../imgs/3ba71cd3e5c4a8bb3f7a83d2726f622d408a16fe.png">.</p>
<p>The linear program would now be as below:</p>
<p>Minimize</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/ddfdd29766e12304bcf98d7f035f1ad6971e585b.png"></p>
<p>Subject to the condition:</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/170a99c7d003ddb4d3fa0059a4c3091e8acb7455.png">; <img src=
"../imgs/c8166b2d08e5757db68cff390951d092a18ccb26.png"></p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/7e948fe2e2c748c0d9ae9415d1e9a1602d826683.png">; <img src=
"../imgs/aa75e609836ce655bdb4b39b1ad73922cca0b26b.png"></p>
<p>Now, have a deeper understanding of the dual of the maximum flow
linear program. The variable <img src=
"../imgs/8c17b80620445b83f64ed3dbaba41d9560fb90bc.png">augments a
weight to each of the edge. This weight can be thought of as the
“length” from source to destination.</p>
<p>Now to find the minimum cut, the flow has to be minimized. So,
the intention over here is to find the path that has the minimum
flow. For this the objective function is intended to find the
minimum path. The same is the yield of the Maximum-Flow-Minimum-Cut
theorem.</p>
<p>Now, the objective function is the subject to the constraints
that for every path that is constituted of the edges the minimum
value is one unit. That means the source and the target are always
separable or it can be said that they are always different nodes of
the network.</p>
<p>Another constraint is that the value of the variable for any
edge has to be either 0 or any positive integer. This ensures that
the capacity can never be negative and that is what the basic rule
for capacity of the flow network says.</p>
<p>This way it can be concluded that the dual of the linear program
of the maximum flow of a network yield the linear program that
represents the minimum cut for the same flow network.</p>

<div class="answer">
<p><b>Weak Duality Formulation:</b></p>
<p>Duality in linear programming is of two types:</p>
<p>1. Weak Duality</p>
<p>2. Strong Duality</p>
<p>For the instance, only Weak duality would be discussed over
here.</p>
<p>Consider that there exists a linear program of the form:</p>
<p>Maximize</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/8507033b3f2f1c1f3143ab555145b63f1b9d6c5b.png"></p>

<p><img src=
"../imgs/fbe86ae9b9b40b5611b2e8feafddc34292781071.png"></p>
<p>And it is dual:</p>
<p>Minimize</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/33f7bca895399dedb3ad936eff05c041b2169ef2.png"></p>
<p>Subject to:</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/3e10a340462c5a375a960db94753d8f92167377c.png"></p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/22191b0cd29ae1ea4acd7e0552a582454ef66732.png"></p>
<p>Suppose both of them are viable.</p>
<p>Now, consider <img src=
"../imgs/9773e1508502d9f761409e4858c7c3933760475a.png">be viable
for primal and <img src=
"../imgs/d5634e45d13b826d788abdffc3e7f995a72575cd.png">be viable
for dual form. This implies that:</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/6679b6105e3afc6d6a989fa935516fbae1c41690.png"></p>
<p>In simple words, the objective function of the primal form of
the linear program has got an upper limitand that is the objective
function of the dual form of the same linear program.</p>
<p>Now, the weak duality is proved for the maximum flow and the
minimum cut.</p>
<p>Consider that <img src=
"../imgs/fde9aea5dd35424d680896532b5645da0fb955bf.png"> is a flow a
network and <img src=
"../imgs/979bb727d0620ed6f273772741aa5ba149bc51c7.png">is minimum
cut of the network.</p>
<p>So it is to be proved that,</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/bf582a3bfddcc7e37c260cc7f0a0557d347a5b5f.png"></p>
<p>As it is known that the flow data from thesource to destination
is always equal to the difference of the flow in the one direction
and the reversedirection.</p>
<p>So,</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/bf97026f2350f911ef6643122f305eec5485e4e4.png"></p>
<p>Now, it is already evident that the flow through any edge is
always less than or equal to the capacity of that edge.</p>
<p>So,</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/482e42ca9a7cca1b919a5206c03cb612be172bce.png"></p>
<p>For a particular instance,</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/5af202556115ce2a5c2c9d77f8ca28aeed0eecdb.png"></p>
<p>Now, as the flow is always nonnegative value,</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/b2587ea09da32b23cf48439f95f9825cef1b703c.png"></p>
<p>And that proves that maximum flow linear program is bounded by
its dual that is the min-cut manifestation.</p>
