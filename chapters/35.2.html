<p><b>Triangle Inequality</b></p>
<p>According to triangle inequality the sum of the length of two
sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side. If this
condition is true for any triangle then the triangle follows the

<p><b>Travelling salesman problem:</b> The travelling salesman
problem follows the triangular inequality. It is the problem in
which a salesman in a city travels to the other cities for selling
his products without repeating any city twice except the city from
where he has started his tour. There is fixed cost incurred for
travelling from one city to the other city.</p>
<p>It can be represented using a graph <i>G</i> (<i>V</i>,
<i>E</i>) in which <i>V</i> is the number of nodes which represents
the number of cities the salesman visits. The number of edges
<i>E</i> of the graph are representing the <i>r</i> out that is
followed by the salesman. The cost for any route from <i>u</i> to
<i>v</i> is <img src=
"../imgs/ad26d83e5fa0b12aa545d16be4a9dfeef937fdeb.png">which is
shown on the edges of the graph. The graph showing the travelling
salesman problem is as:</p>

alt="C:\Users\evelyn 16\Desktop\CDR TIP\8.tif"></p>
<p>In the above graph it is shown that the salesman starts his tour
from city <i>a</i> he goes to the city <i>b</i> from there he goes
forward to <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i> and <i>f</i> after thathe
came back to city <i>a</i>. The cost of each route is shown on the
respective edges.</p>

<p><b>Metric Travelling salesman problem</b>: This is the TSP which
follows triangular inequality, and minimum cost is incurred while
visiting each vertex single time. According to metric travelling
salesman problem the cost elapsed for travelling from one city to
other is less than that cost if he follows any indirect route.</p>
<p><b>For example:</b> The cost of going from <i>u</i> to <i>v</i>
will be lesser than the cost incurred when he goes from <i>u</i> to
<i>w</i> and then from <i>w</i> to <i>v</i>. This shows the
inequality because the sum of cost incurred in the indirect path is
greater than the cost in the direst path. That is the sum of two
sides of triangle is greater than one side.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="answer">
<p>The algorithm to solve the metric TSP is as:</p>
<p><b>Algorithm</b>:</p>
<p>// A MST is a spanning tree which has minimum weight of all the
spanning trees.</p>
<p>1. Find minimum spanning tree from <i>G.</i></p>
<p>// increase every edge of MST to get a eulerian graph.</p>
<p>2. Increase each of the minimum spanning trees to get an
Eulerian graph <img src=
"../imgs/c3aaa48060187f9a957d30a34ba061d10b34ecd8.png"></p>
<p>// Eulerian circuit is a path which each vertex only once and
start and it is trailing on</p>
<p>// same vertex.</p>
<p>3. Find out Eulerian circuit <i>E</i> from<img src=
"../imgs/c3aaa48060187f9a957d30a34ba061d10b34ecd8.png">.</p>
<p>4. Output the vertices of <img src=
"../imgs/5672f6e111ce86b3ddeefa437947ad630f9e892d.png"> as found
out in<img src=
"../imgs/785d06b44a2a7034681ca36a42913ba51658fb76.png">.</p>
<p>In the above algorithm first step is to find the minimum
spanning tree (MST) for the graph. The minimum spanning tree is the
graph without any cycle such that it can cover all the vertices of
the graph and its weight or cost is lesser than all other spanning
trees for the same graph.</p>
<p>After that is finds the Euler graph for the MST, for finding the
Euler graph it extends the edges of MST. Euler graph is the one
that contains the Euler cycle and Euler cycle is path which
contains each edge of the graph exactly once. Now, the Euler
circuit for the graph is calculated which is the path in which each
vertex is added only once accept the starting vertex which is also
the ending vertex.</p>
<p><b>TSP WITH THREE VERTICES:</b> Consider the graph <img src=
"../imgs/4cc43aed229122177e5d1f3ff5bf237bfbc3bb92.png">with three
vertices <i>u</i>, <i>v</i>, and <i>w</i>. it is the graph with
three edges and is a complete undirected graph as shown below:</p>

alt="C:\Users\evelyn 16\Desktop\CDR TIP\14.tif"></p>
<p>The cost of the edges of the graph is as:</p>
<p>Cost function <i>c</i> in going from <i>u</i> to
<i>v</i>=<img src=
"../imgs/ad26d83e5fa0b12aa545d16be4a9dfeef937fdeb.png"></p>

<i>w</i>=<img src=
"../imgs/3d9d9976accfed67d413f19c9fe7c08a1b8cac1d.png"></p>
<p>Hence, the cost incurred in this MST travelling salesman problem
will be:</p>
<p><img src=
"../imgs/e4b1c5edee8832409e3fdbdc40a5908a69f08a8a.png"></p>
<p>The reason is this; in any triangle the basis property is that
any two side length sum is greater than the third one side. So,
here triangle side length is same as cost from one point to other
and points are same as vertices as in the triangle.</p>
<p>Now, if there is any transformation of triangle in any traveling
sales man problem structure the triangular inequality can be
applied to check which route has less cost charges. If triangle
inequality fails it means those point cannot make any triangle
structure.</p>
<p>Thus, it is proved that <img src=

<p>An optimal tour never crosses itself can be shown by eliminating
a crossing always results in a tour with smallest cost.</p>
<p>Now, consider the following figure:</p>

<p>In the above figure, the crossing is eliminating by replacing
the given edge<img src=

<p>According to triangle inequality of Euclidian distance, the sum
of two side’s cost in a triangle must be greater than to the cost
